8. Ruby-Red Margarita--Dallas
"If your crowd is into margaritas, try a version with Texas grapefruit instead of lime--colorful and delicious!" --Sarah Kane, Culinary Art Catering, Dallas

Fill a cocktail shaker with ice; add 1½ oz. silver tequila, ½ oz. triple sec, 2 oz. ruby-red grapefruit juice, the juice from half a lemon and half a lime, agave nectar (to taste), and 2 to 3 grapefruit segments. Cover and shake until very cold. Pour into a salt-rimmed glass and garnish with a grapefruit slice.

    Add 1 1/2 measures of whiskey (bourbon or rye) to a shaker 2/3 full of ice.
    Add 1/2 part sweet vermouth and 1/2 dry vermouth (I’m making mine ‘perfect’ feel free to experiment with different ratios of vermouth).
    Add 1/2 measure of maple syrup and two dashes of your favourite bitters (aged whiskey or orange go well).
    Shake well and double strain into a cocktail glass. Garnish with a cherry.
