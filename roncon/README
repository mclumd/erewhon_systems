11) start a controller, obsAvoid, by typing:
   telnet> send marvin start obsAvoid
   (you should see a robot move forward and turn to avoid the other)

12) stop the controller using:
   telnet> send marvin stop obsAvoid
   (the robot should stop moving)

13) you can play with starting and stopping the other available
