The Frame System can be used as a standalone knowledge representation
infrastructure or as a support subsystem for the Meta-AQUA system. The file
frame-sys-def.lisp contains the defsystem specification of the system. The file
application-frame-demo.lisp is not part of the system itself. It illustrates
the use of the system as a stand alone unit.

To use the frame system as part of Meta-AQUA, see the file INSTALL in the
Meta-AQUA root directory. 

To compile the frame system as standalone unit, perform the following steps.

0. Change the :default-pathname string in the defsystem specification of file
   frame-sys-def.lisp to point to the root directory for the Frame System.
1. Start alisp
2. (load "frame-sys-def.lisp")
3. (compile-system 'FRAME-SYSTEM)

To load the frame system as standalone unit, perform the following steps.

0. Examine application-frame-demo.lisp to understand demo
1. Start alisp
2. (load "frame-sys-def.lisp")
3. (load-system 'FRAME-SYSTEM)
