<h1> The Alma GUI</h1>

This is a user guide to the alma gui. For more detail as to how to invoke
it, look at the sample html files.

<hr>

<h3> Overview </h3>
This is a GUI for a running alma process or for alma history files.
 The state of the alma kb is kept track of through the history output. 
 There is also a connection to the stdio of alma through which all the
 usual alma commands can be executed
 <br>
 There are three main windows: the KB display window, the alma control
 window and the IO window. 
<br>

<hr>

<h3> Arguments </h3>
<br>
 There are two main modes of operation: as an interface to a running 
 alma process or as a history reader. In the latter case only the KB 
 display window is produced. Also, in the latter case, the applet is
 viewable using netscape whereas in the former case, the applet will
 run with the appletviewer.
 <br>
 Arguments: <br>
 <ul>
 <li>
 almaArgs. The value of this should be the string that is to be used to
 exec alma. The default is: "alma run false keyboard true histocket htcp 
 prompt false". If you decide to change that, make sure that the histocket,
 prompt, and keyboard values are as in the default.
 <li>
 autoExec. The value is true or false. The default is false. If it is true,
 alma will be execed on start-up, otherwise it will be execed when the
 'Exec' button is clicked.
 <li>
 historyFromFile. Value true or false. If true, the GUI will run in 
 hostory reader mode. Default is false. The history file can be specified
 in the GUI or through the next parameter.
 <li>
 historyInputURLName. The value of that is the URL for the history file
 that is to be read. There is no default.
 <li>
 verbose. Value is true or false. Default is false. 
 <li>
 historyOutput. Value is a file name. This is to be used when the GUI
 is connected to a running Alma process and we want to record the
 history. The file name is the name of the file in which the history
 will be recorded.
 <li>
 prologSocketFile. Value is a file name. This is used when the GUI is
 connected to a running Alma process. The file name is the name of the
 file in which the socket information is written. This has to be
 coordinated with the Alma arguments.
 </ul>

<h3> The history display </h3>

 The formulas are displayed as:
 <br>
 &lt FORMULA NAME &gt : &lt PRINTABLE FORMULA &gt
 <br>
 The formula name is a string that can be used to identify the formula
 in other literals. The printable formula is an intuitive rendering
 of the formula though it may not correspond exactly to the formula
 entered.
 <br>
 The formulas added at the beginning of the current step are colored
 green.
 <br>
 Clicking on a formula will pop out a window with information about
 the formula  as in:
<br>

<br>
 The control panel is:
 <img src="dbcontrol.gif">
 <br>
 <ul>
 <li>
 The first button dispalys the first step in the history.
 <li>
 The second button moves back one step in the history.
 <li>
 The third button, causes the step in the text field to be displayed.
 <li>
 The text field serves to display the step number of the step that is
 being displayed. It is editable and can also be used to specify a 
 particular step to display.
 The fourth button causes the next step to be displayed. If there are no
 more steps, this will not cause new steps to be computed.
 <li>
 The fifth button causes the last step to be displayed. This serves
 another purpose which is to synchronize the display with the input
 steps. 
 </ul>
 In usual operation, with alma computing steps instead of reading
 from a file, the latest available step is displayed. However,
 if any one of the buttons but the last is used, the display is no
 longer synchronized with the steps that are being computed by alma.
 This allows one to inspect previous steps without always jumping to 
 the latest step. 
 <br>
 The last button resynchronizes the display with the running alma so
 that the latest computed step is displayed.
 <br>
 In history file mode, an additional panel is displayed:
 <br>
 <img src="urlload.gif">
 <br>
 This allows one to load new history files. Loading a new file causes
 the previous information to be lost.
<p>

<h3> The alma control panel </h3>

  The control panel enables the user to control the running of alma.
 <br>
 <img src="execcontrol.gif">
 <br>
 The following controls are provided:
 <ul>
 <li>
 Exec. If alma is not automatically started, clicking this will
 start alma. This will not work if alma is already up.
 <li>
 Step. This causes alma to step once. If alma is automatically stepping,
 the results might be unexepcted.
 <li>
 Run. This causes alma to step continuously with a delay between steps
 as specified by the next control. If alma is run with "run true", this
 might not have the expected results.
 <li>
 Delay. The delay can be specified in milliseconds. Making the delay
 shorter than is possible for the alma executable does no good.
 <li>
 Stop. This stops alma from stepping if that was initiated by the Run
 button. It has no effect on a "run true" alma process.
 Reset. This resets alma. It is effective for both an automatically
 stepping alma process and one controlled from the GUI.
</ul>

<hr>

<h3> The IO panel </h3>

 The IO panel reads and writes to the alma process though stdio.
 <br>
 <img src="io.gif">
 <br>
 There are two windows: one for input and one for output.
 <br>
 The window for input expects the same syntax as one would type at
 the alma keyboard. To send a command to alma, click on "Send" or hit
 return. 
 <br>
 The up and down keys (^ and V) traverse the history of the commands
 typed. 
 <br>
 The output window displays whatever alma outputs to stdout.
