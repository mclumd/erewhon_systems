Imagine that the manufacturers of the systems listed below, will
re-tailor the base models to suit your specific needs. List the various
features (upgrades) you would like each system to have, that would
cater to your needs. For example, if there is a switch that can turn a
light on or off, an additional feature you might like is to have an
associated timer that you can set, to turn the light on or off at
pre-determined times; but this is merely an example -- use your
imagination, but also please try to stick with realistic features
rather than science- fiction.



1. A switch that can turn a light on or off.




2. A (primitive) microwave that can be just switched on and off. So,
if you need to heat milk for 20 seconds, YOU need to put the milk in,
YOU need to switch it on, YOU need to keep note of the time, YOU need
to wait for 20 seconds and then YOU need to switch it off.




3. A CD player that displays the current track and can play, rewind,
fast forward or stop. 




4. A room heater that displays the current temperature and can be
switched on or off. 




5. A remote-controlled car starter that displays the status of the
engine - running or stopped and can start or stop the engine. 




6. A motion-sensitive camera that takes a picture whenever it senses
any movement. The only features that the base model have are to turn
the camera on or off.




7. A self-propelled vacuum cleaner that has controls for switching the
vacuum on or off, moving forward, backward, left or right, switching
the brush on or off and switching the suction on or off.




8. A chess program that can play a game of chess against you.




9. A washer cum driver that has controls for washing, drying, or doing
both and for selecting quick, normal, handwash, or delicate cycle.




10. A garden sprinkler system that displays the humidity and has
controls for setting the current time and the period in which the
sprinklers should be on everyday.
