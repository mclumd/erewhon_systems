High-level Requirements:

ALFRED should be able to

1. Add new domains in a straightforward way.
2. Modify domain knowledge, English language knowledge or the concept space in a straightforward way.
3. Accept a subset of natural language sentences.
4. Translate info into proper domain commands. This includes detecting the proper domain for the information and translating that information to appropriate commands.
5. Accept natural language sentences that are commands for ALFRED to perform some action on itself.
6. Translate domain information strings and translate them to natural language sentences. This could be prompted by the user or unprompted. Such domain information could be:
    i)  Sensor readings
    ii) acknowledgments (acknowledging that a command has been received, for example)
    iii)system status information
    iv) log reports
    v)  ping (i.e. repetitively informing the user that the connection is being maintained)
7. Maintain a conceptual relationship between domains.
8. Perform dialogue management, which would include the following:
    i)  acknowledging the existence of multiple participants in a dialogue
    ii) handle turn-taking in a dialogue
    iii)understanding and maintaining dialogue structures (e.g. a question/answers template)
9. Do meta-linguistic reasoning:
    i)  linguistic items at the same level of abstraction should be entities in ALFRED's knowledge-base
    ii) do repairs in concept space/natural language/domain knowledge


Questions:

1. Does ALFRED need to do it's own contradiction handling?
2. What do we want done in the concept space?
3. What are the linguistic/conceptual/domain knowledge representations that we require?
4. What actions will be performed on the representations mentioned in (3)?

Some definitions:

A domain language is:
1. It is a set of strings
2. It can be generated by a finite state grammar
3. It has a finite vocabulary
4. It can include parameters such as numbers

Natural language is:
1. It is a set of strings made of letters/numbers
2. It has a vocabulary
3. It can be generated by context free grammar rules
4. It has syntax to semantic mapping

Concepts are:
1. Sentences in first order predicate logic
2. Contains first order logic symbols, predicates
