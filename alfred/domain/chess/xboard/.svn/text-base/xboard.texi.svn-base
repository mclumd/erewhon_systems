@cindex What is it?
@value{NAME}
is a graphical chessboard that can serve as a
user interface to the GNU Chess and Crafty chess engines, the
Internet Chess Servers,
electronic mail correspondence chess, or your own collection of saved games.
These Web pages document version @value{VERSION} of @value{NAME}.
@end ifset

@node Installation
@chapter How to configure, compile and install @value{NAME}
@cindex Installation

@value{NAME} is normally distributed as source, in a file with a name like
@file{xboard-*.tar.gz}.  You need to unpack this file and compile the results
with a C compiler.  

First, decide where you want to install the xboard executable program and
documentation.  The default is to put them under the @file{/usr/local}
directory tree.  If you want to put them somewhere else, such as under your
home directory, change the value in the @samp{--prefix} option below.

Use the following commands:

@example
gzip -cd xboard-*.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
cd xboard-*/
configure --prefix=/usr/local
make
make install
@end example

If you have any problems with these steps,
see the file @file{INSTALL} in the @value{NAME} distribution for
detailed instructions on options you can give to @code{configure},
and see the file @file{FAQ} for answers to frequently asked questions.

If everything works, you can delete the whole @file{xboard-*} directory after
@samp{make install} is done.

@node Invocation
@chapter Command options supported by @value{NAME}
@cindex Invocation
@cindex Options

@value{NAME} always runs in one of four major modes:

@table @asis
@item @value{LCNAME} [options]
runs @value{NAME} as an interface to a chess engine running
on your machine, such as GNU Chess or Crafty. In this mode,
@value{NAME} lets you play a game against the chess engine, set up
arbitrary positions, force variations, or watch a game between two
chess engines.
@item @value{LCNAME} -ics -icshost hostname [options]
runs @value{NAME} as an interface to the Internet Chess Server
(ICS). You can play against other ICS users, observe games they are
playing, or review games that have recently finished. @xref{ICS}.
All the ``wild'' chess variants on ICS are supported, including bughouse.
@item @value{LCNAME} -ncp [options]
lets you use @value{NAME} as a simple chessboard to play through
games. It will read and write game files and allow you to play
through variations manually. You can use it to browse games off the
net or review games you have saved.
These features are also available in the other modes.
If you want to pipe games into @value{NAME}, use the supplied
shell script @file{pxboard}.  For example, from the news reader @file{xrn},
find a message with one or more games in it,
click the Save button, and type @samp{|pxboard} as the file name.
@item cmail
uses @value{NAME} as an interface to electronic mail
correspondence chess.
@xref{CMail}.
@end table

Most of the @value{NAME} options have both a long name and a short
name. To turn a boolean option on or off from the command line,
either give its long name followed by the value @code{true} or
@code{false} (@samp{-longOptionName true}), or give just the short
name to turn the option on (@samp{-opt}), or the short name
preceded by @samp{x} to turn the option off (@samp{-xopt}). For
options that take strings or numbers as values, you can use the
long or short option names interchangeably.

Each option corresponds to an X resource with the same name, so
if you like, you can set options in your @file{.Xdefaults} file
or in a file named @file{XBoard} in your home directory.
For options that have two names, the longer one is the name of
the corresponding X resource; the short name is not recognized.
To turn a boolean option on or off as an
X resource, give its long name followed by the value
@code{true} or @code{false}:

@example
XBoard*longOptionName: true
@end example

@node Chess engine options
@section Controlling the chess engine
@cindex options, Chess engine
@cindex Chess engine options
@table @asis
@item -tc or -timeControl minutes[:seconds]
@cindex tc, option
@cindex timeControl, option
Each player begins with his clock set to the @code{timeControl} period.
Default: 5 minutes.
The additional options @code{movesPerSession} and @code{timeIncrement}
are mutually exclusive.  

@item -mps or -movesPerSession moves
@cindex mps, option
@cindex movesPerSession, option
When both players have made @code{movesPerSession} moves, a
new @code{timeControl} period is added to both clocks.  Default: 40 moves.

@item -inc or -timeIncrement seconds
@cindex inc, option
@cindex timeIncrement, option
If this option is specified, @code{movesPerSession} is ignored.
Instead, after each player's move, @code{timeIncrement} seconds are
added to his clock.  
Use @samp{-inc 0} if you want to require the entire
game to be played in one @code{timeControl} period, with no increment.
Default: -1, which specifies @code{movesPerSession} mode.

@item -clock/-xclock or -clockMode True/False
@cindex clock, option
@cindex clockMode, option
Determines whether or not to display the chess clocks. If clockMode is
@samp{false}, the clocks are not shown, but the side that is to play next
is still highlighted. Also, unless @code{searchTime}
is set, the chess engine still keeps track of the clock time and uses it to
determine how fast to make its moves.

@item -st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]
@cindex st, option
@cindex searchTime, option
Tells the chess engine to spend at most the given amount of time
searching for each of its moves. Without this option, the chess engine
chooses its search time based on the number of moves and amount
of time remaining until the next time control.
Setting this option also sets clockMode to False.

@item -depth or -searchDepth number
@cindex sd, option
@cindex searchDepth, option
Tells the chess engine to look ahead at most the given number of moves
when searching for a move to make. Without this option, the chess
engine chooses its search depth based on the number of moves and
amount of time remaining until the next time control.  With the option,
the engine will cut off its search early if it reaches the specified depth.

@item -thinking/-xthinking or -showThinking True/False
@cindex thinking, option
@cindex showThinking, option
Sets the Show Thinking option. @xref{Options Menu}. Default: false.

@item -ponder/-xponder or -ponderNextMove True/False
@cindex ponder, option
@cindex ponderNextMove, option
Sets the Ponder Next Move menu option. @xref{Options Menu}. Default: True.

@item -mg or -matchGames n
@cindex mg, option
@cindex matchGames, option
Automatically runs an n-game match between two chess engines,
with alternating colors.
If the @code{loadGameFile} or @code{loadPositionFile} option is set,
@value{NAME}
starts each game with the given opening moves or the given position;
otherwise, the games start with the standard initial chess position.
If the @code{saveGameFile} option is set, a move record for the
match is appended to the specified file. If the @code{savePositionFile}
option is set, the final position reached in each game of the match is appended
to the specified file. When the match is over, @value{NAME}
displays the match score and exits. Default: 0 (do not run a match).

@item -mm/-xmm or -matchMode True/False
@cindex mm, option
@cindex matchMode, option
Abbreviation for -matchGames 1.

@item -fcp or -firstChessProgram program
@cindex fcp, option
@cindex firstChessProgram, option
Name of first chess engine.
Default: @file{gnuchessx}.

@item -scp or -secondChessProgram program
@cindex scp, option
@cindex secondChessProgram, option
Name of second chess engine, if needed.
A second chess engine is started only in Two Machines (match) mode.
Default: @file{gnuchessx}.

@item -fb/-xfb or -firstPlaysBlack True/False
@cindex fb, option
@cindex firstPlaysBlack, option
In games between two chess engines, firstChessProgram normally
plays white.  (This is a change from earlier versions of @value{NAME}.)
If this option is True, firstChessProgram plays black.
In a multi-game match, this option affects the colors only for
the first game; they still alternate in subsequent games.

@item -fh or -firstHost host
@itemx -sh or -secondHost host
@cindex fh, option
@cindex firstHost, option
@cindex sh, option
@cindex secondHost, option
Hosts on which the chess engines are to run. The default for
each is @file{localhost}. If you specify another host, @value{NAME}
uses @file{rsh} (1) to run the chess engine there. (You can substitute a
different remote shell program for rsh using the @code{remoteShell}
option described below.)

@item -fd or -firstDirectory dir
@itemx -sd or -secondDirectory dir
@cindex fd, option
@cindex firstDirectory, option
@cindex sd, option
@cindex secondDirectory, option
Working directories in which the chess engines are to be run.
The default is "", which means to run the chess engine
in the same working directory as @value{NAME}
itself.  (See the CHESSDIR environment variable.)
This option is effective only when the chess engine is being run
on the local host; it does not work if the engine is run remotely
using the -fh or -sh option.

@item -initString string
@itemx -secondInitString string
@cindex initString, option
@cindex secondInitString, option
The string that is sent to initialize each chess engine for a new game.
Default:

@example
new
random
@end example
@noindent
Setting this option from the command line is tricky, because you must
type in real newline characters, including one at the very end.
In most shells you can do this by
entering a @samp{\} character followed by a newline. It is easier to set
the option from your @file{.Xdefaults} file; in that case you can
include the character sequence @samp{\n} in the string, and it will
be converted to a newline.

If you change this option, don't remove the @samp{new} 
command; it is required by all chess engines to
start a new game.

You can remove the @samp{random} command if you like;
including it causes GNU Chess to randomize its move selection
slightly so that it doesn't play the same moves in every game.
Even without @samp{random}, GNU Chess randomizes its choice of moves
from its opening book.  Crafty
ignores this command; it randomizes by default.

You can also try adding other
commands to the initString; see the GNU Chess or Crafty documentation for
details.

@item -firstComputerString string
@itemx -secondComputerString string
@cindex firstComputerString, option
@cindex secondComputerString, option
The string that is sent to the chess engine if its opponent is another
computer chess engine.  The default is @samp{computer\n}.  Probably the
only useful alternative is the empty string (@samp{}), which keeps the
engine from knowing that it is playing another computer.

@item -reuse/-xreuse or -reuseFirst True/False
@itemx -reuse2/-xreuse2 or -reuseSecond True/False
@cindex reuse, option
@cindex reuseFirst, option
@cindex reuse2, option
@cindex reuseSecond, option
If the option is false,
@value{NAME} kills off the chess engine after every game and starts
it again for the next game.  
If the option is true (the default), 
@value{NAME} starts the chess engine only once
and uses it repeatedly to play multiple games.
Some chess engines may not work properly when
reuse is turned on, such as versions of Crafty earlier than 12.0,
but otherwise new games will start faster if it is left on.

@item -firstProtocolVersion version-number
@itemx -secondProtocolVersion version-number
@cindex firstProtocolVersion, option
@cindex secondProtocolVersion, option
This option specifies which version of the chess engine communication
protocol to use.  By default, version-number is 2.  In version 1, the
"protover" command is not sent to the engine; since version 1 is a
subset of version 2, nothing else changes.  Other values for
version-number are not supported.

@node ICS options
@section Connecting to and using ICS
@cindex ICS options
@cindex Options, ICS
@table @asis
@item -ics/-xics or -internetChessServerMode True/False
@cindex ics, option
@cindex internetChessServerMode, option
Connect with an Internet Chess Server to play chess against its
other users, observe games they are playing, or review games
that have recently finished. Default: false.
To use @value{NAME} in ICS mode, run it in the foreground, and use the
terminal you started it from to type commands and receive text
responses from the chess server.
@xref{ICS}. @xref{File Menu}. @xref{Step Menu}.
@xref{Mode Menu}.

@item -icshost or -internetChessServerHost host
@cindex icshost, option
@cindex internetChessServerHost, option
The Internet host name or address of the chess server to connect
to when in ICS mode. Default: @code{chessclub.com}. See the file
@file{ics-addresses} in the @value{NAME}
distribution for a list of other addresses to try.
If your site doesn't have a working Internet name server, try
specifying the host address in numeric form. 
You may also need
to specify the numeric address when using the icshelper option
with timestamp or timeseal (see below).
At this writing
@code{chessclub.com} is @samp{207.99.5.190} and
@code{freechess.org} is @samp{164.58.253.13}.

@item -icsport or -internetChessServerPort port-number
@cindex icsport, option
@cindex internetChessServerPort, option
The port number to use when connecting to a chess server in ICS
mode. Default: 5000.

@item -icshelper or -internetChessServerHelper prog-name
@cindex icshelper, option
@cindex internetChessServerHelper, option
An external helper program used to communicate with the chess server.
You would set it to "timestamp" for ICC (chessclub.com) or
"timeseal" for FICS (freechess.org, eics.daimi.aau.dk, etc.), after
obtaining the correct version of timestamp or timeseal for your
computer.  See "help timestamp" on ICC and "help timeseal" on FICS.
This option is shorthand for @code{-useTelnet -telnetProgram program}.

@item -telnet/-xtelnet or -useTelnet True/False
@cindex telnet, option
@cindex useTelnet, option
This option is poorly named; it should be called useHelper.
If set to true, it instructs @value{NAME} to run an external
program to communicate with the Internet Chess Server. 
The program to use is given by the telnetProgram option.
If the option is
false (the default), @value{NAME} opens a TCP socket and uses its own
internal implementation of the telnet protocol to communicate with the
ICS. @xref{Firewalls}.

@item -telnetProgram prog-name
@cindex telnetProgram, option
This option is poorly named; it should be called helperProgram.
It gives the name of the telnet program to be used with
the @code{gateway} and @code{useTelnet} options.  The default is
@file{telnet}. The telnet program is invoked with the value of
@code{internetChessServerHost} as its first argument and the value
of @code{internetChessServerPort} as its second argument.
@xref{Firewalls}.

@item -gateway host-name
@cindex gateway, option
If this option is set to a host name, @value{NAME} uses @file{rsh} (1) to run
the @file{telnet} (1) program on the given host to communicate with the
Internet Chess Server instead of using its own internal implementation
of the telnet protocol. You can substitute a different remote shell
program for @file{rsh} using the @code{remoteShell} option described below.
@xref{Firewalls}.

@item -internetChessServerCommPort or -icscomm dev-name
@cindex internetChessServerCommPort, option
@cindex icscomm, option
If this option is set, @value{NAME} communicates with the ICS through
the given character I/O device instead of opening a TCP connection.
Use this option if your system does not have any kind of
Internet connection itself (not even a SLIP or PPP connection),
but you do have dialup access (or a hardwired terminal line) to
an Internet service provider from which you can telnet to the
ICS.

The support for this option in @value{NAME} is minimal. You need to
set all communication parameters and tty modes before you enter
@value{NAME}.

Use a script something like this:

@example
stty raw -echo 9600 > /dev/tty00
@value{LCNAME} -ics -icscomm /dev/tty00
@end example

Here replace @samp{/dev/tty00} with the name of the device that your
modem is connected to. You might have to add several more
options to these stty commands. See the man pages for @file{stty} (1)
and @code{tty} (4) if you run into problems. Also, on many systems stty
works on its standard input instead of standard output, so you
have to use @samp{<} instead of @samp{>}.

If you are using linux, try starting with the script below.
Change it as necessary for your installation.

@example
####################################################
#!/bin/sh -f
# configure modem and fire up @value{NAME}

# configure modem
(
  stty 2400 ; stty raw ; stty hupcl ; stty -clocal
  stty ignbrk ; stty ignpar ; stty ixon ; stty ixoff
  stty -iexten ; stty -echo
) < /dev/modem
@value{LCNAME} -ics -icscomm /dev/modem
####################################################
@end example
@noindent
After you start @value{NAME} in this way, type whatever commands are
necessary to dial out to your Internet provider and log in.
Then telnet to ICS, using a command like

@example
telnet chessclub.com 5000
@end example
@noindent
Important: See the paragraph below about extra echoes, 
in @ref{Limitations}.

@item -icslogon or -internetChessServerLogonScript file-name
@cindex icslogon, option
@cindex internetChessServerLogonScript, option
@cindex .icsrc
Whenever @value{NAME} connects to the Internet Chess Server,
if it finds a file with the name given in this option, it feeds the
file's contents to the ICS as commands. The default file name
is @file{.icsrc}.
Usually the first two lines of the file should be
your ICS user name and password.
The file can be either in $CHESSDIR, in @value{NAME}'s working
directory if CHESSDIR is not set, or in your home directory.

@item -msLoginDelay delay
@cindex msLoginDelay, option
If you experience trouble logging on to an ICS when using the
@code{-icslogon} option, inserting some delay between characters
of the logon script may help. This option adds @code{delay}
milliseconds of delay between characters. Good values to try
are 100 and 250.

@item -icsinput/-xicsinput or -internetChessServerInputBox True/False
@cindex icsinput, option
@cindex internetChessServerInputBox, option
Sets the ICS Input Box menu option. @xref{Mode Menu}. Default: false.

@item -autocomm/-xautocomm or -autoComment True/False
@cindex autocomm, option
@cindex autoComment, option
Sets the Auto Comment menu option. @xref{Options Menu}. Default: False.

@item -autoflag/-xautoflag or -autoCallFlag True/False
@cindex autoflag, option
@cindex autoCallFlag, option
Sets the Auto Flag menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}. Default: false.

@item -autobs/-xautobs or -autoObserve True/False
@cindex autobs, option
@cindex autoObserve, option
Sets the Auto Observe menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}. Default: false.

@item -moves/-xmoves or -getMoveList True/False
@cindex moves, option
@cindex getMoveList, option
Sets the Get Move List menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}.  Default: true.

@item -alarm/-xalarm or -icsAlarm True/False
@cindex alarm, option
@cindex icsAlarm, option
Sets the ICS Alarm menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}. Default: true.

@item -icsAlarmTime ms
@cindex icsAlarmTime, option
Sets the time in milliseconds for the ICS Alarm menu option. 
@xref{Options Menu}. Default: 5000.

@item -pre/-xpre \fRor\fB -premove True/False
@cindex pre, option
@cindex premove, option
Sets the Premove menu option. @xref{Options Menu}. Default: true.

@item -quiet/-xquiet or -quietPlay True/False
@cindex quiet, option
@cindex quietPlay, option
Sets the Quiet Play menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}.  Default: false.

@item -colorizeMessages or -colorize
@cindex Colors
@cindex colorize, option
Setting colorizeMessages
to True tells XBoard to colorize the messages received from
the ICS.  Colorization works only if your xterm 
supports ISO 6429 escape sequences for changing text colors.

@item -colorShout foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorSShout foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorChannel1 foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorChannel foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorKibitz foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorTell foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorChallege foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorRequest foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorSeek foreground,background,bold
@itemx -colorNormal foreground,background,bold
@cindex Colors
@cindex colorShout, option
@cindex colorSShout, option
@cindex colorChannel1, option
@cindex colorChannel, option
@cindex colorKibitz, option
@cindex colorTell, option
@cindex colorChallenge, option
@cindex colorRequest, option
@cindex colorSeek, option
@cindex colorNormal, option
These options set the colors used when colorizing ICS messages.
All ICS messages are grouped into one of these categories:
shout, sshout, channel 1, other channel, kibitz, tell, challenge, 
request (including abort, adjourn, draw, pause, and takeback), or
normal (all other messages).  

Each foreground or background argument can be one of the following:
black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, or default.
Here ``default'' means the default foreground or background color of
your xterm.  Bold can be 1 or 0.  If background is omitted, ``default''
is assumed; if bold is omitted, 0 is assumed.

Here is an example of how to set the colors in your @file{.Xdefaults} file.
The colors shown here are the default values; you will get
them if you turn @code{-colorize} on without specifying your own colors.
@example
    xboard*colorizeMessages: true	
    xboard*colorShout: green
    xboard*colorSShout: green, black, 1
    xboard*colorChannel1: cyan
    xboard*colorChannel: cyan, black, 1
    xboard*colorKibitz: magenta, black, 1
    xboard*colorTell: yellow, black, 1
    xboard*colorChallenge: red, black, 1
    xboard*colorRequest: red
    xboard*colorSeek: blue
    xboard*colorNormal: default

@item -soundProgram progname
@cindex soundProgram, option
@cindex Sounds
If this option is set to a sound-playing program that is installed and
working on your system, @value{NAME} can play sound files when certain
events occur, listed below.  The default program name is "play".  If
any of the sound options is set to "$", the event rings the terminal
bell by sending a ^G character to standard output, instead of playing
a sound file.  If an option is set to the empty string "", no sound is
played for that event.

@cindex legal, option
@cindex testLegality, option
If this option is true (the default), 
@value{NAME}
tests whether moves you try to make with the mouse are legal, and
refuses to let you make an illegal move.  Moves loaded from a file
with @samp{Load Game} are also checked.
If the option is false, all moves are accepted.
If GNU Chess, Crafty, or the ICS is active,
they will still reject illegal moves.  Turning off this option is
useful if you are playing a chess variant with rules that 
@value{NAME}
does not understand.

@item -size or -boardSize (sizeName | n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6,n7)
@cindex size, option
@cindex boardSize, option
@cindex board size
Determines how large the board will be, by selecting the pixel size
of the pieces and setting a few related parameters.
The sizeName can be one of: Titanic, giving 129x129 pixel pieces,
Colossal 116x116, Giant 108x108, Huge 95x95, Big 87x87, Large 80x80, Bulky 72x72,
Medium 64x64, Moderate 58x58, Average 54x54, Middling 49x49, Mediocre
45x45, Small 40x40, Slim 37x37, Petite 33x33, Dinky 29x29, Teeny 25x25,
or Tiny 21x21.
Pieces of all these sizes are built into @value{NAME}.
Other sizes can
be used if you have them; see the pixmapDirectory and bitmapDirectory
options.
The default depends on the size of your screen; it is approximately the
largest size that will fit without clipping.

You can select other sizes or vary other layout parameters by providing
a list of comma-separated values (with no spaces) as the argument.
You do not need to provide all the values; for any you omit from the
end of the list, defaults are taken from the nearest built-in size.
The value @code{n1} gives the piece size, @code{n2} the width of the
black border
between squares, @code{n3} the desired size for the 
clockFont, @code{n4} the desired size for the coordFont,
@code{n5} the desired size for the default font,
@code{n6} the smallLayout flag (0 or 1), 
and @code{n7} the tinyLayout flag (0 or 1).  
All dimensions are in pixels.
If the border between squares is eliminated (0 width), the various
highlight options will not work, as there is nowhere to draw the highlight.
If smallLayout is 1 and @code{titleInWindow} is True, 
the window layout is rearranged to make more room for the title.
If tinyLayout is 1, the labels on the menu bar are abbreviated
to one character each and the buttons in the button bar are made narrower.

@item -coords/-xcoords or -showCoords True/False
@cindex coords, option
@cindex showCoords, option
Sets the Show Coords menu option.  @xref{Options Menu}.  Default: false.
The @code{coordFont} option specifies what font to use.

@item -autoraise/-xautoraise or -autoRaiseBoard True/False
@cindex autoraise, option
@cindex autoRaiseBoard, option
Sets the Auto Raise Board menu option.  Default: true.

@item -autoflip/-xautoflip or -autoFlipView True/False
@cindex autoflip, option
@cindex autoFlipView, option
Sets the Auto Flip View menu option.  Default: true.

@item -flip/-xflip or -flipView True/False
@cindex flip, option
@cindex flipView, option
If Auto Flip View is not set, or if you are observing but not participating
in a game, then the positioning of the board at the start of each game
depends on the flipView option.  If flipView is False (the default),
the board is positioned so that the white pawns move from the bottom to the
top; if True, the black pawns move from the bottom to the top.
In any case, the Flip menu option can be used to flip the board after
the game starts.

@item -title/-xtitle or -titleInWindow True/False
@cindex title, option
@cindex titleInWindow, option
If this option is true, @value{NAME} displays player names (for ICS
games) and game file names (for @samp{Load Game}) inside its main
window. If the option is false (the default), this information is
displayed only in the window banner. You probably won't want to
set this option unless the information is not showing up in the
banner, as happens with a few X window managers.

@item -mono/-xmono or -monoMode True/False
@cindex mono, option
@cindex monoMode, option
Determines whether @value{NAME} displays its pieces and squares with
two colors (true) or four (false). You shouldn't have to
specify @code{monoMode}; @value{NAME} will determine if it is necessary.

@item -flashCount count
@itemx -flashRate rate
@itemx -flash
@itemx -xflash
@cindex flashCount, option
@cindex flashRate, option
@cindex flash, option
@cindex xflash, option
These options enable flashing of pieces when they
land on their destination square.
@code{flashCount}
tells XBoard how many times to flash a piece after it
lands on its destination square.
@code{flashRate}
controls the rate of flashing (flashes/sec).
Abbreviations:
@code{flash}
sets flashCount to 3.
@code{xflash}
sets flashCount to 0.
Defaults:  flashCount=0 (no flashing), flashRate=5.

@item -highlight/-xhighlight or -highlightLastMove True/False
@cindex highlight, option
@cindex highlightLastMove, option
Sets the Highlight Last Move menu option. Default: false.

@item -blind/-xblind or -blindfold True/False
@cindex blind, option
@cindex blindfold, option
Sets the Blindfold menu option.  Default: false.

@item -clockFont font
@cindex clockFont, option
@cindex Font, clock
The font used for the clocks. If the option value is a pattern
that does not specify the font size, @value{NAME} tries to choose an
appropriate font for the board size being used.
Default: -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.

@item -coordFont font
@cindex coordFont, option
@cindex Font, coordinates
The font used for rank and file coordinate labels if @code{showCoords}
is true. If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
the font size, @value{NAME} tries to choose an appropriate font for
the board size being used.
Default: -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.

@item -font font
@cindex font, option
@cindex Font
The font used for popup dialogs, menus, comments, etc.
If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
the font size, @value{NAME} tries to choose an appropriate font for
the board size being used.
Default: -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal--*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.

@item -fontSizeTolerance tol
@cindex fontSizeTolerance, option
In the font selection algorithm, a nonscalable font will be preferred
over a scalable font if the nonscalable font's size differs by tol pixels
or less from the desired size.  A value of -1 will force
a scalable font to always be used if available; a value of 0 will
use a nonscalable font only if it is exactly the right size; 
a large value (say 1000) will force a nonscalable font to always be
used if available.  Default: 4.

@item -bm or -bitmapDirectory dir
@itemx -pixmap or -pixmapDirectory dir
@cindex bm, option
@cindex bitmapDirectory, option
@cindex pixmap, option
@cindex pixmapDirectory, option
These options control what piece images xboard uses.  The @value{NAME}
distribution includes one set of pixmap pieces in xpm format, in the
directory @file{pixmaps}, and two sets of bitmap pieces in xbm format,
in the directories @file{bitmaps} and @file{bitmaps.xchess}.  Pixmap
pieces give a better appearance on the screen: the white pieces have
dark borders, and the black pieces have opaque internal details.  With
bitmaps, neither piece color has a border, and the internal details
are transparent; you see the square color or other background color
through them.

If @value{NAME} is configured and compiled on a system that includes libXpm,
the X pixmap library, the xpm pixmap pieces are compiled in as the
default.  A different xpm piece set can be selected at runtime with
the @code{pixmapDirectory} option, or a bitmap piece set can be selected
with the @code{bitmapDirectory} option.

If @value{NAME} is configured and compiled on a system that does not include
libXpm (or the @code{--disable-xpm} option is given to the configure
program), the bitmap pieces are compiled in as the default.  It is not
possible to use xpm pieces in this case, but pixmap pieces in another
format called "xim" can be used by giving the @code{pixmapDirectory} option.
Or again, a different bitmap piece set can be selected with the
@code{bitmapDirectory} option.

Files in the @code{bitmapDirectory} must be named as follows:
The first character of a piece bitmap name gives the piece it 
represents (@samp{p}, @samp{n}, @samp{b}, @samp{r}, @samp{q}, or @samp{k}),
the next characters give the size in pixels, the
following character indicates whether the piece is
solid or outline (@samp{s} or @samp{o}),
and the extension is @samp{.bm}.
For example, a solid 80x80 knight would be named @file{n80s.bm}.
The outline bitmaps are used only in monochrome mode.
If bitmap pieces are compiled in and the bitmapDirectory is missing
some files, the compiled in pieces are used instead.

If the bitmapDirectory option is given,
it is also possible to replace xboard's icons and menu checkmark,
by supplying files named @file{icon_white.bm}, @file{icon_black.bm}, and
@file{checkmark.bm}.

For more information about pixmap pieces and how to get additional
sets, see @ref{zic2xpm}.

@item -variant varname
@cindex variant, option

Activates preliminary, partial support for playing chess variants
against a local engine or editing variant games.  This flag is not
needed in ICS mode.  Recognized variant names are:

@example
  normal        Normal chess
  wildcastle    Shuffle chess, king can castle from d file
  nocastle      Shuffle chess, no castling allowed
  fischerandom  Fischer Random shuffle chess
  bughouse      Bughouse, ICC/FICS rules
  crazyhouse    Crazyhouse, ICC/FICS rules
  losers        Lose all pieces or get mated (ICC wild 17)
  suicide       Lose all pieces including king (FICS)
  giveaway      Try to have no legal moves (ICC wild 26)
  twokings      Weird ICC wild 9
  kriegspiel    Opponent's pieces are invisible
  atomic        Capturing piece explodes (ICC wild 27)
  3check        Win by giving check 3 times (ICC wild 25)
  shatranj      An ancient precursor of chess (ICC wild 28)
  unknown       Catchall for other unknown variants
@end example

In the shuffle variants, xboard does not shuffle the pieces, but
you can do it by hand using Edit Position.  Some variants are
supported only in ICS mode, including fischerandom, bughouse, and
kriegspiel.  The winning/drawing conditions in crazyhouse (offboard
interposition on mate), losers, suicide, giveaway, atomic, and 3check
are not fully understood.  In crazyhouse, xboard does not yet keep
track of offboard pieces.  Shatranj is unsupported, but it may be
usable if you turn off Test Legality.

@item Reset
@cindex Reset, Menuitem
Resets @value{NAME} and the chess engine to the beginning of a new chess
game. The @samp{r} key is a keyboard equivalent. In Internet Chess
Server mode, clears the current state of @value{NAME}, then
resynchronizes with ICS by sending a refresh command. If you want to
stop playing, observing, or examining a game on ICS, use an
appropriate command from the Action menu, not @samp{Reset}. @xref{Action
Menu}.

@item Load Game
@cindex Load Game, Menuitem
Plays a game from a record file. The @samp{g} key is a keyboard equivalent.
A popup dialog prompts you for the file name. If the file contains more
than one game, a second popup dialog
displays a list of games (with information drawn from their PGN tags, if
any), and you can select the one you want. Alternatively, you can load the
Nth game in the file directly, by typing the number @samp{N} after the
file name, separated by a space.

The game file parser will accept PGN (portable game notation),
or in fact almost any file that contains moves in algebraic
notation. 
Notation of the form @samp{P@@f7}
is accepted for piece-drops in bughouse games;
this is a nonstandard extension to PGN.
If the file includes a PGN position (FEN tag), or an
@value{NAME} position diagram bracketed by @samp{[--} and @samp{--]}
before the first move, the game starts from that position. Text
enclosed in parentheses, square brackets, or curly braces is assumed to
be commentary and is displayed in a pop-up window. Any other
text in the file is ignored. PGN variations (enclosed in
parentheses) are treated as comments; @value{NAME} is not able to walk
variation trees.
The nonstandard PGN tag [Variant "varname"] functions similarly to
the -variant command-line option (see below), allowing games in certain chess
variants to be loaded.  There is also a heuristic to 
recognize chess variants from the Event tag, by looking for the strings
that the Internet Chess Servers put there when saving variant ("wild") games.

@item Load Next Game
@cindex Load Next Game, Menuitem
Loads the next game from the last game record file you loaded.
The shifted @samp{N} key is a keyboard equivalent.
Not available if the last game was loaded from a pipe.

@item Load Previous Game
@cindex Load Previous Game, Menuitem
Loads the previous game from the last game record file you
loaded.  The shifted @samp{P} key is a keyboard equivalent.
Not available if the last game was loaded from a pipe.

@item Reload Same Game
@cindex Reload Same Game, Menuitem
Reloads the last game you loaded.

@item Save Game
@cindex Save Game, Menuitem
Appends a record of the current game to a file.
A popup dialog
prompts you for the file name. If the game did not begin with
the standard starting position, the game file includes the
starting position used. Games are saved in the PGN (portable
game notation) format, unless the oldSaveStyle option is true,
in which case they are saved in an older format that is specific
to @value{NAME}. Both formats are human-readable, and both can be
read back by the @samp{Load Game} command.
Notation of the form @samp{P@@f7}
is accepted for piece-drops in bughouse games;
this is a nonstandard extension to PGN.

@item Copy Game
@cindex Copy Game, Menuitem
Copies a record of the current game to an internal clipboard in PGN
format and sets the X selection to the game text.  The game can be
pasted to another application (such as a text editor or another copy
of @value{NAME}) using that application's paste command.  In many X
applications, such as xterm and emacs, the middle mouse button can be
used for pasting; in @value{NAME}, you must use the Paste Game command.

@item Paste Game
@cindex Paste Game, Menuitem
Interprets the current X selection as a game record and loads it, as
with Load Game.

@item Load Position
@cindex Load Position, Menuitem
Sets up a position from a position file.  A popup dialog prompts
you for the file name. If the file contains more than one saved
position, and you want to load the Nth one, type the number N
after the file name, separated by a space. Position files must
be in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation), or in the format that the
Save Position command writes when oldSaveStyle is turned on.

@item Load Next Position
@cindex Load Next Position, Menuitem
Loads the next position from the last position file you loaded.
Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe.

@item Load Previous Position
@cindex Load Previous Position, Menuitem
Loads the previous position from the last position file you
loaded.  Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe.

@item Reload Same Position
@cindex Reload Same Position, Menuitem
Reloads the last position you loaded.

@item Save Position
@cindex Save Game, Menuitem
Appends a diagram of the current position to a file.
A popup dialog
prompts you for the file name. Positions are saved in
FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation) format unless the @code{oldSaveStyle}
option is true, in which case they are saved in an older,
human-readable format that is specific to @value{NAME}. Both formats
can be read back by the @samp{Load Position} command.

@item Copy Position
@cindex Copy Position, Menuitem
Copies the current position to an internal clipboard in FEN format and
sets the X selection to the position text.  The position can be pasted
to another application (such as a text editor or another copy of
@value{NAME}) using that application's paste command.  In many X
applications, such as xterm and emacs, the middle mouse button can be
used for pasting; in @value{NAME}, you must use the Paste Position command.

@item Paste Position

XBoard tells Crafty to start analyzing the current game/position
and shows you the analysis as you move pieces around.

To setup a position to analyze, you do the following:

1. Select Edit Position from the Mode Menu

2. Setup the position (use the right and middle buttons to
bring up the Black/White piece menus).

3. When you are finished, click on either the Black or White
clock to tell XBoard which side moves first.

4. Select Analysis Mode from the Mode Menu to start the analysis.

@item Analyze File
@cindex Analyze File, Menuitem
XBoard with Crafty only.
For information on getting Crafty, see @ref{Crafty}.

This option lets you load a game from a file (PGN, XBoard format, etc.)
and analyze it. When you select this menu item, a popup window appears
and asks for a filename to load.
If the file contains multiple games, another popup appears that lets
you select which game you wish to analyze.
After a game is loaded, use the XBoard arrow buttons to step
forwards/backwards through the game and watch Crafty's analysis.

@item ICS Client
@cindex ICS Client, Menuitem
ICS mode only. Takes @value{NAME} out of the Edit Game or
Edit Position state.

While you are examining a game on the ICS, you can issue the ICS
position-editing commands with the mouse. Do this with @samp{ICS
Client} selected on the Mode menu, not @samp{Edit Position}; the latter
edits only your local copy of the position.

To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over
the square. This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or
black pieces (button 3).
Additional menu choices let you empty the square or clear the board.
You cannot set the side to play or drag pieces to arbitrary squares
while examining on ICS, however; the ICS permits only legal moves
in this mode.

If you are playing a bughouse game on the ICS, you can drop an offboard piece
by pressing mouse button 2 or 3 over an empty square to bring up a piece menu.
It makes no difference which button you use.  
A list of the offboard pieces
each player has available is shown in the window title after the player's name.

@item Edit Game
@cindex Edit Game, Menuitem
Allows you to make moves for both Black and White, and to change
moves after backing up with the @samp{Backward} command. The clocks do
not run.

In GNU Chess mode, the chess engine continues to check moves for legality
but does not participate in the game. You can bring the chess engine
into the game by selecting @samp{Machine White}, @samp{Machine Black},
or @samp{Two Machines}.

In ICS mode, the moves are not sent to the ICS: @samp{Edit Game} takes
@value{NAME} out of ICS Client mode and lets you edit games locally.
If you want to edit games on ICS in a way that other ICS users
can see, use the ICS examine command or start an ICS match
against yourself.

@item Edit Position
@cindex Edit Position, Menuitem
Lets you set up an arbitrary board position.
Use mouse button 1 to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece
by dragging it off the board or dragging an empty square on top of it.
To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over the
square. This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or
black pieces (button 3). Additional menu choices let you empty the
square or clear the board. You can set the side to play next by
clicking on the White or Black indicator at the top of the screen.
Selecting @samp{Edit Position} causes @value{NAME} to discard
all remembered moves in the current game.

In ICS mode, changes made to the position by @samp{Edit Position} are
not sent to the ICS: @samp{Edit Position} takes @value{NAME} out of
@samp{ICS Client} mode and lets you edit positions locally. If you want to
edit positions on ICS in a way that other ICS users can see, use
the @samp{ICS examine} command, or start an ICS match against yourself.
(See also the ICS Client topic above.)

@item Training
@cindex Training, Menuitem
Training mode lets you interactively guess the moves of a game for one
of the players. You guess the next move of the game by playing the
move on the board. If the move played matches the next move of the
game, the move is accepted and the opponent's response is autoplayed.
If the move played is incorrect, an error message is displayed.  You
can select this mode only while loading a game (that is, after
selecting Load Game from the File menu).  While @value{NAME} is in Training
mode, the navigation buttons are disabled.

@item Show Game List
@cindex Show Game List, Menuitem
Shows or hides the list of games generated by the last @samp{Load Game}
command.

@item Edit Tags
@cindex Edit Tags, Menuitem
Lets you edit the PGN (portable game notation)
tags for the current game. After editing, the tags must still conform to
the PGN tag syntax:

@example
<tag-section> ::= <tag-pair> <tag-section>
                        <empty>
<tag-pair> ::= [ <tag-name> <tag-value> ]
<tag-name> ::= <identifier>
<tag-value> ::= <string>
@end example
@noindent
See the PGN Standard for full details. Here is an example:

@example
[Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
[Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
[Date "1958.08.16"]
[Round "8"]
[White "Robert J. Fischer"]
[Black "Bent Larsen"]
[Result "1-0"]
@end example
@noindent
Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored. Note that
the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the seven tags shown
above. Any that you omit will be filled in by @value{NAME}
with @samp{?} (unknown value), or @samp{-} (inapplicable value).

@item Edit Comment
@cindex Edit Comment, Menuitem
Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
saved by @samp{Save Game} and are displayed by @samp{Load Game},
@samp{Forward}, and @samp{Backward}.

@item ICS Input Box
@cindex ICS Input Box, Menuitem
If this option is set in ICS mode,
@value{NAME}
creates an extra window that you can use for typing in ICS commands.
The input box is especially useful if you want to type in something long or do
some editing on your input, because output from ICS doesn't get mixed
in with your typing as it would in the main terminal window.

@item Pause
@cindex Pause, Menuitem
Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against a chess engine,
also pauses your clock. To continue, select @samp{Pause} again, and the
display will automatically update to the latest position.
The @samp{P} button and keyboard @samp{p} key are equivalents.

If you select Pause when you are playing against a chess engine and
it is not your move, the chess engine's clock
will continue to run and it will eventually make a move, at which point
both clocks will stop. Since board updates are paused, however,
you will not see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward).
This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

If you select Pause while you are in
@code{examine} mode on ICS, you can step backward and forward in the
current history of the examined game without affecting the other observers
and examiners. Select Pause again to reconnect yourself to the current state
of the game on ICS.

If you select @samp{Pause} while you are loading a game, the game stops
loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting @samp{Forward}, or
resume automatic loading by selecting @samp{Pause} again.

@item Backward
@cindex Backward, Menuitem
@cindex <, Button
Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.
The @samp{[<]} button and the @samp{b} key are equivalents.
In addition, pressing the Control key steps back one move, and releasing
it steps forward again.

In most modes, @samp{Backward} only lets you look back at old positions;
it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing against
a chess engine, playing or observing a game on the ICS, or loading a game.
If you select @samp{Backward} in any of these situations, you will not
be allowed to make a different move. Use @samp{Retract Move} or
@samp{Edit Game} if you want to change past moves.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @samp{Backward}
depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, @samp{Backward} issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
move. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Backward} only backs up your local
view.

@item Forward
@cindex Forward, Menuitem
@cindex >, Button
Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
effect of @samp{Backward}) or forward through a game file. The
@samp{[>]} button and the @samp{f} key are equivalents.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of Forward
depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
off, @samp{Forward} issues the ICS forward command, which moves
everyone's view of the game forward along the current line. If
Pause mode is on, @samp{Forward} only moves your local view forward,
and it will not go past the position that the game was in when
you paused.

@item Back to Start
@cindex Back to Start, Menuitem
@cindex <<, Button
Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game.
The @samp{[<<]} button and the shifted @samp{B} key are equivalents.

In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you
are playing against GNU chess, playing or observing a game on
the ICS, or loading a game. If you select @samp{Back to Start} in any
of these situations, you will not be allowed to make different
moves. Use @samp{Retract Move} or @samp{Edit Game} if you want to change past
moves; or use Reset to start a new game.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @samp{Back to
Start} depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, @samp{Back to Start} issues the ICS @samp{backward 999999}
command, which backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and
allows you to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Back
to Start} only backs up your local view.

@item Forward to End
@cindex Forward to End, Menuitem
@cindex >>, Button
Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
@samp{[>>]} button and the shifted @samp{F} key are equivalents.

If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of @samp{Forward to
End} depends on whether @value{NAME} is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
is off, @samp{Forward to End} issues the ICS @samp{forward 999999}
command, which moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of
the current line. If Pause mode is on, @samp{Forward to End} only moves
your local view forward, and it will not go past the position
that the game was in when you paused.

@item Revert
@cindex Revert, Menuitem
If you are examining a game on ICS and Pause mode is off, issues
the ICS command @samp{revert}.

@item Truncate Game
@cindex Truncate Game, Menuitem
Discards all remembered moves of the game beyond the current
position. Puts @value{NAME} into @samp{Edit Game} mode if it was not there
already.

@item Move Now
@cindex Move Now, Menuitem
Forces the chess engine to move immediately. GNU Chess mode only.

@item Retract Move
@cindex Retract Move, Menuitem
Retracts your last move. In GNU Chess mode, you can do this only
after the chess engine has replied to your move; if the chess engine is still
thinking, use @samp{Move Now} first. In ICS mode, @samp{Retract Move}
issues the command @samp{takeback 1} or @samp{takeback 2}
depending on whether it is your opponent's move or yours.

@item Always Queen
@cindex Always Queen, Menuitem
If this option is off, @value{NAME} brings up a dialog
box whenever you move a pawn to the last rank, asking what piece
you want to promote it to. If the option is true, your pawns are
always promoted to queens. Your opponent can still underpromote,
however.
@item Animate Dragging
@cindex Animate Dragging, Menuitem
If Animate Dragging is on, while you are dragging a piece with the
mouse, an image of the piece follows the mouse cursor.
If Animate Dragging is off, there is no visual feedback while you are
dragging a piece, but if Animate Moving is on, the move will be
animated when it is complete. 
@item Animate Moving
@cindex Animate Moving, Menuitem
If Animate Moving is on, all piece moves are animated.  An image of the
piece is shown moving from the old square to the new square when the
move is completed (unless the move was already animated by Animate Dragging).
If Animate Moving is off, a moved piece instantly disappears from its
old square and reappears on its new square when the move is complete.
@item Auto Comment
@cindex Auto Comment, Menuitem
If this option is on, any remarks made on ICS while you are observing or
playing a game are recorded as a comment on the current move.  This includes
remarks made with the ICS commands @kbd{say}, @kbd{tell}, @kbd{whisper},
and @kbd{kibitz}.
Limitation: remarks that you type yourself are not recognized;
@value{NAME} scans only the output from ICS, not the input you type to it.
@item Auto Flag
@cindex Auto Flag, Menuitem
If this option is on and one player runs out of time
before the other,
@value{NAME}
will automatically call his flag, claiming a win on time.
In ICS mode, Auto Flag will only call your opponent's flag, not yours,
and the ICS may award you a draw instead of a win if you have
insufficient mating material.  In local chess engine mode,
@value{NAME}
may call either player's flag and will not take material into account.
@item Auto Flip View
@cindex Auto Flip View, Menuitem
If the Auto Flip View option is on when you start a game, the board
will be automatically oriented so that your pawns move from the bottom
of the window towards the top.
@item Auto Observe
@cindex Auto Observe, Menuitem
If this option is on and you add a player to your @code{gnotify}
list on ICS, @value{NAME} will automatically observe all of that
player's games, unless you are doing something else (such as
observing or playing a game of your own) when one starts.
The games are displayed 
from the point of view of the player on your gnotify list; that is, his
pawns move from the bottom of the window towards the top.
Exceptions:  If both players in a game are on your gnotify list, if
your ICS 
@code{highlight}
variable is set to 0, or if the ICS you are using does not 
properly support observing from Black's point of view,
you will see the game from White's point of view.
@item Auto Raise Board
@cindex Auto Raise Board, Menuitem
If this option is on, whenever a new game begins, the chessboard window
is deiconized (if necessary) and raised to the top of the stack of windows.
@item Auto Save
@cindex Auto Save, Menuitem
If this option is true, at the end of every game @value{NAME} prompts
you for a file name and appends a record of the game to the file
you specify. 
Disabled if the @code{saveGameFile} command-line
option is set, as in that case all games are saved to the specified file.
@xref{I/O options}.
@item Blindfold
@cindex Blindfold, Menuitem
If this option is on, @value{NAME} displays the board as usual but does
not display pieces or move highlights.  You can still move in the
usual way (with the mouse or by typing moves in ICS mode), even though
the pieces are invisible.
@item Flash Moves
@cindex Flash Moves, Menuitem
If this option is on, whenever a move is completed, the moved piece flashes.
The number of times to flash is set by the flashCount command-line
option; it defaults to 3 if Flash Moves is first turned on from the menu.

@item Flip View
@cindex Flip View, Menuitem
Inverts your view of the chess board for the duration of the
current game. Starting a new game returns the board to normal.
The @samp{v} key is a keyboard equivalent.

If you are playing a game on the ICS, the board is always
oriented at the start of the game so that your pawns move from
the bottom of the window towards the top. Otherwise, the starting
orientation is determined by the @code{flipView} command line option;
if it is false (the default), White's pawns move from bottom to top
at the start of each game; if it is true, Black's pawns move from
bottom to top. @xref{User interface options}.

@item Highlight Last Move
@cindex Highlight Last Move, Menuitem
If Highlight Last Move is on, after a move is made, the starting and
ending squares remain highlighted. In addition, after you use Backward
or Back to Start, the starting and ending squares of the last move to
be unmade are highlighted.

@item Move Sound
@cindex Move Sound, Menuitem
If this option is on, @value{NAME} alerts you by playing a sound
after each of your opponent's moves (or after every
move if you are observing a game on the Internet Chess Server).
The sound is not played after moves you make or moves read from a
saved game file. By default, the
sound is the terminal bell, but on some systems you can change it
to a sound file using the soundMove option; see below.

If you turn on this option when using @value{NAME} with the Internet
Chess Server, you will probably want to give the

@example
set bell 0
@end example
@noindent
command to the ICS, since otherwise the ICS will ring the terminal bell
after every move (not just yours). (The @file{.icsrc} file
is a good place for this, @pxref{ICS options})

@item ICS Alarm
@cindex ICS Alarm, Menuitem
When this option is on, an alarm sound is played when your clock
counts down to the icsAlarmTime (by default, 5 seconds) in an ICS
game.  For games with time controls that include an increment, the
alarm will sound each time the clock counts down to the icsAlarmTime.
By default, the alarm sound is the terminal bell, but on some systems
you can change it to a sound file using the soundIcsAlarm option; see
below.

@item Get Move List
@cindex Get Move List, Menuitem
If this option is on, whenever @value{NAME}
receives the first board of a new game (or a different game from
the one it is currently displaying), it
retrieves the list of past moves from the ICS.
You can then review the moves with the @samp{Forward} and @samp{Backward}
commands
or save them with @samp{Save Game}.  You might want to
turn off this option if you are observing several blitz games at once,
to keep from wasting time and network bandwidth fetching the move lists over
and over.
When you turn this option on from the menu, @value{NAME}
immediately fetches the move list of the current game (if any).

@item Old Save Style
@cindex Old Save Style, Menuitem
If this option is off, @value{NAME} saves games in PGN
(portable game notation) and positions in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards
notation).  If the option is on, a save style that is compatible
with older versions of @value{NAME} is used instead.
The old position style is more human-readable
than FEN; the old game style has no particular advantages.

@item Periodic Updates
@cindex Periodic Updates, Menuitem
If this option is off (or if
you are using a chess engine that does not support periodic updates),
the analysis window
will only be updated when the analysis changes. If this option is
on, the Analysis Window will be updated every two seconds.

@item Ponder Next Move
@cindex Ponder Next Move, Menuitem
If this option is off, the chess engine will think only when it is on
move.  If the option is on, the engine will also think while waiting
for you to make your move.

@item Popup Exit Message
@cindex Popup Exit Message, Menuitem
If this option is on, when @value{NAME} wants to display a message just
before exiting, it brings up a modal dialog box and waits for you to
click OK before exiting.  If the option is off, @value{NAME} prints the
message to standard error (the terminal) and exits immediately.

@item Popup Move Errors
@cindex Popup Move Errors, Menuitem
If this option is off, when you make an error in moving (such as
attempting an illegal move or moving the wrong color piece), the
error message is displayed in the message area.  If the option is
on, move errors are displayed in small popup windows like other errors.
You can dismiss an error popup either by clicking its OK button or by
clicking anywhere on the board, including downclicking to start a move.

@item Premove
@cindex Premove, Menuitem
If this option is on while playing a game on ICS, you can register
your next planned move before it is your turn.  Move the piece with
the mouse in the ordinary way, and the starting and ending squares
will be highlighted with a special color (red by default).  When it is
your turn, if your registered move is legal, xboard will send it to
ICS immediately; if not, it will be ignored and you can make a
different move.  If you change your mind about your premove, either
make a different move, or double-click on any piece to cancel the move
entirely.

@item Quiet Play
@cindex Quiet Play, Menuitem
If this option is on, @value{NAME} will automatically issue an ICS

@example
set shout 0
@end example
@noindent
command whenever you start a game and a

@example
set shout 1
@end example
@noindent
command whenever you finish one.  Thus, you will not be distracted
by shouts from other ICS users while playing.

@item Show Coords
@cindex Show Coords, Menuitem
If this option is on, @value{NAME} displays algebraic coordinates
along the board's left and bottom edges.

@item Show Thinking
@cindex Show Thinking, Menuitem
If this option is set, the chess engine's notion of the score and best
line of play from the current position is displayed as it is
thinking. The score indicates how many pawns ahead (or if negative,
behind) the chess engine thinks it is. In matches between two
machines, the score is prefixed by @samp{W} or @samp{B} to indicate
whether it is showing White's thinking or Black's.

not graphical ones, check its documentation; there is probably a way to
enable graphical icons. If you are running the Motif window manager

watch other people's games, or just chat.
You can use either @code{telnet} or
a client program like @value{NAME} to connect to the server.
ICS is getting more and more important for chess players: 
There are thousands of registered users on the different
ICS hosts, and it is not unusual to meet 200 on both ICC and FICS.
The number is increasing rapidly.

Most people can just type

@example
@value{LCNAME} -ics

@noindent
to start @value{NAME} as
an ICS client.  Invoking @value{NAME} in this way connects you to
the Internet Chess Club (ICC), a commercial ICS.  You can log in there as
a guest even if you do not have a paid account.  To connect to
the largest Free ICS (FICS), use the command

@example
@value{LCNAME} -ics -icshost freechess.org
@end example
@noindent
instead, or substitute a different host name to connect to your
favorite ICS.
The @file{ics-addresses} in the 
@value{NAME} distribution includes a list of ICS hosts.
For a full description of command-line options that control 
the connection to ICS and change the default values of ICS options, see
@ref{ICS options}.  

While you are running @value{NAME} as an ICS client,
you use the terminal window that you started @value{NAME} from
as a place to type in commands and read information that is
not available on the chessboard.

The first time you need to use the terminal is to enter your login name
and password, if you are a registered player. (You don't need to do
this manually; the @code{icsLogon} option can do it for you.
@pxref{ICS options})  If you are not registered, enter any name.
If someone has already registered under that name, you'll be
asked for a password; just hit return and try again.
Or on ICC, you can enter @samp{g} as your name, and ICC will pick a
unique (but boring) name for you.

Some useful ICS commands
include
@table @kbd
@item help <topic>
@cindex help, ICS command
to get help on the given <topic>. To get a list of possible topics type
@dfn{help} without topic.  Try the help command before you ask other
people on the server for help.

For example @kbd{help register} tells you how to become a registered
ICS player.
@item who <flags>
@cindex who, ICS command
to see a list of people who are logged on.  Administrators
(people you should talk to if you have a problem) are marked
with the character @samp{*}, an asterisk. The <flags> allow you to
display only selected players: For example, @kbd{who of} shows a
list of players who are interested in playing but do not have
an opponent.
@item games
@cindex games, ICS command
to see what games are being played
@item match <player> [<mins>] [<inc>]
to challenge another player to a game. Both opponents get <mins> minutes
for the game, and <inc> seconds will be added after each move.
If another player challenges you, the server asks if you want to
accept the challenge; use the @kbd{accept} or @kbd{decline} commands
to answer.
@item accept
@itemx decline
@cindex accept, ICS command
@cindex decline, ICS command
to accept or decline another player's offer. 
The offer may be to start a new game, or to agree to a 
@kbd{draw}, @kbd{adjourn} or @kbd{abort} the current game. @xref{Action Menu}.

If you have more than one pending offer (for example, if more than one player
is challenging you, or if your opponent offers both a draw and to adjourn the
game), you have to supply additional information, by typing something
like @kbd{accept <player>}, @kbd{accept draw}, or @kbd{draw}.

@item draw
@itemx adjourn
@itemx abort
@cindex draw, ICS command
@cindex adjourn, ICS command
@cindex abort, ICS command
asks your opponent to terminate a game by mutual agreement. Adjourned
games can be continued later. 
Your opponent can either @kbd{decline} your offer or accept it (by typing the
same command or typing @kbd{accept}).  In some cases these commands work
immediately, without asking your opponent to agree.  For example, you can
abort the game unilaterally if your opponent is out of time, and you can claim
a draw by repetition or the 50-move rule if available simply by typing 
@kbd{draw}.
@item finger <player>
@cindex finger, ICS command
to get informations about the given <player>. (Default: yourself.)
@item vars
@cindex vars, ICS command
to get a list of personal settings
@item set <var> <value>
@cindex set, ICS command
to modify these settings
@item observe <player>
@cindex observe, ICS command
to observe an ongoing game of the given <player>.
@item examine
@itemx oldmoves
@cindex examine, ICS command
@cindex oldmoves, ICS command
to review a recently completed game
@end table

Some special @value{NAME} features are activated when you are
in examine mode on ICS.  See the descriptions of the menu commands
@samp{Forward}, @samp{Backward}, @samp{Pause}, @samp{ICS Client}, 
and @samp{Stop Examining} on the @ref{Step Menu}, @ref{Mode Menu}, and
@ref{Options Menu}.

@node Firewalls
@chapter Connecting to the ICS through a firewall
By default, @value{NAME} communicates with an Internet Chess Server
by opening a TCP socket directly from the machine it is running on
to the ICS. If there is a firewall between your machine and the ICS,
this won't work. Here are some recipes for getting around common
kinds of firewalls using special options to @value{NAME}.
Important: See the paragraph in the below about extra echoes, in
@ref{Limitations}.

Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can telnet
to a firewall host, log in, and then telnet from there to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called @samp{fire.wall.com}. Set
command-line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -icshost fire.wall.com -icsport 23
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: fire.wall.com
XBoard*internetChessServerPort: 23
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, you will be prompted
to log in to the firewall host. (This works because port 23 is the
standard telnet login service.) Do so, then telnet to ICS, using a
command like @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000}, or whatever command
the firewall provides for telnetting to port 5000.

If your firewall lets you telnet (or rlogin) to remote hosts, but
doesn't let you telnet to port 5000, you will have to find some
other host outside the firewall that does let you do this, and
hop through it. For instance, suppose you have an account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Follow the recipe above, but instead of typing
@samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000} to the firewall, type
@samp{telnet foo.edu} (or @samp{rlogin foo.edu}), log in there, and
then type @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000}.

Exception: chessclub.com itself lets you connect to the chess server on the
default telnet port (23), which is what you get if you don't specify a port
to the telnet program. But the other chess servers don't allow this.

Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can use rsh
to run programs on a firewall host, and that host can telnet to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called @samp{rsh.wall.com}. Set
command-line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -gateway rsh.wall.com -icshost chessclub.com
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*gateway: rsh.wall.com
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: chessclub.com
@end example
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, it will connect to
the ICS by using @file{rsh} to run the command @samp{telnet
chessclub.com 5000} on host @samp{rsh.wall.com}.

Suppose that you can telnet anywhere you want, but you have to
run a special program called @file{ptelnet} to do so.

First, we'll consider the easy case, in which
@samp{ptelnet chessclub.com 5000} gets you to the chess server.
In this case set command line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*useTelnet: true
XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, it will issue the
command @samp{ptelnet chessclub.com 5000} to connect to the ICS.

Next, suppose that @samp{ptelnet chessclub.com 5000} doesn't work;
that is, your @file{ptelnet} program doesn't let you connect to
alternative ports. In this case, you will have to find some other
host outside the firewall that does let you do this, and hop
through it. For instance, suppose you have an account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Set command line options as follows:

@example
xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet -icshost foo.edu -icsport ""
@end example
@noindent
Or in your @file{.Xdefaults} file:

@example
XBoard*useTelnet: true
XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
XBoard*internetChessServerHost: foo.edu
XBoard*internetChessServerPort:
@end example
@noindent
Then when you run @value{NAME} in ICS mode, it will issue the
command @samp{ptelnet foo.edu} to connect to your account at
@samp{foo.edu}. Log in there, then type @samp{telnet chessclub.com 5000}.

ICC timestamp and FICS timeseal do not work through many
firewalls.  You can use them only if your firewall gives a clean TCP
connection with a full 8-bit wide path.  If your firewall allows you
to get out only by running a special telnet program, you can't use
timestamp or timeseal across it.  But if you have access to a
computer just outside your firewall, and you have much lower netlag
when talking to that computer than to the ICS, it might be worthwhile
running timestamp there.  Follow the instructions above for hopping
through a host outside the firewall (foo.edu in the example),
but run timestamp or timeseal on that host instead of telnet.

Suppose that you have a SOCKS firewall that requires you to go through
some extra level of authentication, but after that will give you a
clean 8-bit wide TCP connection to the chess server.  In that case,
you could make a socksified version of 
@value{NAME}
and run that.  If you are using timestamp or timeseal,
you will to socksify it, not
@value{NAME};
this may be difficult seeing that ICC and FICS do not
provide source code for these programs.
Socksification is beyond the scope of this document, but
see the SOCKS Web site at http://www.socks.nec.com/how2socksify.html.

@node Environment
@chapter Environment variables
@cindex Environment variables
@cindex CHESSDIR
Game and position files are found in a directory named by the
@code{CHESSDIR} environment variable. If this variable is not set, the
current working directory is used. If @code{CHESSDIR} is set,
@value{NAME} actually changes its working directory to
@code{$CHESSDIR}, so GNU Chess listing files will also be stored there
as well.

@node Limitations
@chapter Known limitations and bugs
@cindex Limitations
@cindex Bugs
There is no way for two people running copies of @value{NAME} to play
each other without going through the @code{Internet Chess Server}.

Under some circumstances, your ICS password may be echoed when you log on.

If you are connecting to the ICS by running telnet on an Internet provider
or firewall host, you may find that each line you type is echoed back an extra
time after you hit Return. If your Internet provider is a Unix system, you can
probably turn its echo off by typing

@example
stty -echo
@end example
@noindent
after you log in, and/or typing @key{^E-Return} (@key{control-E} followed by
the @key{Return} key) to the telnet program after you have logged into ICS.
It is a good idea to do this if you can, because the extra echo can
occasionally confuse @value{NAME}'s parsing routines.

The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

The internal move legality tester does not look at the game history,
so in some cases it misses illegal castling or en passant captures.
It permits castling with the king on the d file because this is possible in
some "wild 1" games on ICS.  It does not check
piece drops in bughouse and crazyhouse to see if you actually
hold the piece you are trying to drop.
However, if you attempt an illegal move when using
GNU Chess (or the ICS), @value{NAME} will accept the error message
that comes back, undo the move, and let you try another.

Fischer Random castling is not understood.  You can probably play
Fischer Random successfully on ICS by typing castling moves into the ICS
Interaction window, but they will not be animated correctly, and saved
games will not be loaded correctly if castling occurs.

FEN positions saved by @value{NAME}
never include correct information about whether castling is legal or
how many half-moves have been made since the last irreversible move,
and sometimes may not correctly indicate when en passant capture is available.

The mate detector does not understand that non-contact mate is not
really mate in bughouse and crazyhouse.  The only problem this causes
while playing is minor: a @samp{#} (mate indicator) character will show
up after a non-contact mating move in the move list; @value{NAME} will
not assume the game is over at that point.  However, if you are editing
a game, Edit Game mode will be terminated by a non-contact mate.

Some @value{NAME} functions may not work with versions of GNU Chess earlier
than 4.0, patchlevel 77,
or with versions of Crafty earlier than 15.11.
A few functions work with GNU Chess but not Crafty, or vice versa.

The menus may not work if your keyboard is in Caps Lock or Num Lock mode.
This seems to be a problem with the Athena menu widget,
not an @value{NAME} bug.

Also see the ToDo file included with the distribution for many other
possible bugs, limitations, and ideas for improvement that have been
suggested.

@node CMail game
@section Starting a CMail game.
Type @file{cmail} from a shell to start a game as white. After an opening
message, you will be prompted for a game name, which is optional -- if you
simply press return, the game name will take the form
@samp{you-VS-opponent}. You will next be prompted for the short name
of your opponent. If you haven't played this person before, you will also
be prompted for his/her email address. @file{cmail} will then invoke
@value{NAME} in the background. Make your first move and select
@samp{Mail Move} from the @samp{File} menu. @xref{File Menu}. If all is well,
@file{cmail} will mail a copy of the move to your opponent. If you select
@samp{Exit} without having selected @samp{Mail Move} then no move will be
made.


@node CMail answer
@section Answering a move.
When you receive a message from an opponent containing a move in one of
your games, simply pipe the message through @file{cmail}. In some mailers
this is as simple as typing @kbd{| cmail} when viewing the message, while in
others you may have to save the message to a file and do @kbd{cmail < file}
at the command line. In either case @file{cmail} will display the game using
@value{NAME}. If you didn't exit @value{NAME} when you made your first move
then @file{cmail} will do its best to use the existing @value{NAME} instead
of starting a new one. As before, simply make a move and select
@samp{Mail Move} from the @samp{File} menu. @xref{File Menu}. @file{cmail}
will try to use the
@value{NAME} that was most recently used to display the current game. This
means that many games can be in progress simultaneously, each with its own
active @value{NAME}.

If you want to look at the history or explore a variation, go ahead, but
you must return to the current position before @value{NAME} will allow you
to mail a move. If you edit the game's history you must select
@samp{Reload Same Game} from the @samp{File} menu to get back to the original
position, then make the move you want and select @samp{Mail Move}.
As before, if you decide you aren't ready to make a move just yet you can
either select @samp{Exit} without sending a move or just leave
@value{NAME} running until you are ready.

Because @value{NAME} can now detect checkmate and stalemate, @file{cmail}
now handles game termination sensibly. As well as resignation, the
@samp{Action} menu now allows draws to be offered and accepted for
@file{cmail} games.

For multi-game messages, only unfinished and just-finished games will be
included in email messages. When all the games are finished, they are
archived in the user's archive directory, and similarly in the opponent's
when he or she pipes the final message through @file{cmail}. The archive
file name includes the date the game was started.

It's possible to have a @file{cmail} message carry more than one game.
This feature was implemented to handle IECG (International Email Chess
Group) matches, where a match consists of 1 game as white and 1 as black,
with moves transmitted simultaneously. In case there are more general uses,
@file{cmail} itself places no limit on the number of black/white games
contained in a message; however, @value{NAME} does.


@node CMail trouble
@section Known CMail problems.
It's possible that a strange conjunction of conditions may occasionally
mean that @file{cmail} has trouble reactivating an existing
@value{NAME}. If this should happen, simply trying it again should work.
If not, remove the file that stores the @value{NAME}'s PID
(@file{game.pid}) or use the @samp{-xreuse} option to force
@file{cmail} to start a new @value{NAME}.

Versions of @file{cmail} after 2.16 no longer understand the old file format
that @value{NAME} used to use and so cannot be used to correspond with
anyone using an older version.

Versions of @file{cmail} older than 2.11 do not handle multi-game messages,
so multi-game correspondence is not possible with opponents using an older
version.

You can use XBoard to play a game against GNU Chess, or to
interface GNU Chess to an ICS.

@node Crafty
@section Crafty

Crafty is a chess engine written by Bob Hyatt (hyatt@@cis.uab.edu).
You can use XBoard to play a game against Crafty, hook Crafty up
to an ICS, or use Crafty to interactively analyze games and positions
for you.

Crafty is a strong, rapidly evolving chess program. This rapid
pace of development is good, because it means Crafty is always
getting better.  This can sometimes cause problems with
backwards compatibility, but usually the latest version of Crafty
will work well with the latest version of @value{NAME}.
Crafty can be obtained from its author's FTP site:
ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/.

To use Crafty with XBoard, give the -fcp and -fd options as follows, where
<crafty's directory> is the directory in which you installed Crafty
and placed its book and other support files.

@node zic2xpm
@section zic2xpm

The ``zic2xpm'' program is used to import chess sets from the ZIICS(*)
program into XBoard. ``zic2xpm'' is part of the XBoard distribution.
ZIICS is available from:

ftp://ftp.freechess.org/pub/chess/DOS/ziics131.exe


To import ZIICS pieces, do this:

@table @asis
@item 1. Unzip ziics131.exe into a directory:

@example
unzip -L ziics131.exe -d ~/ziics
@end example

@item 2. Use zic2xpm to convert a set of pieces to XBoard format.

For example, let's say you want to use the
FRITZ4 set. These files are named ``fritz4.*'' in the ZIICS distribution.

@example
mkdir ~/fritz4
cd ~/fritz4
zic2xpm ~/ziics/fritz4.*
@end example

@item 3. Now, either give XBoard the ``-pixmap'' option when starting up, e.g.:

@example
xboard -pixmap ~/fritz4
@end example

Or, add this line to your .Xdefaults file:

@example
xboard*pixmapDirectory: ~/fritz4
@end example
