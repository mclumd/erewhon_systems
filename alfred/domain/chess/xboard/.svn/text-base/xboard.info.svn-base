How to configure, compile and install XBoard
********************************************

   XBoard is normally distributed as source, in a file with a name like
`xboard-*.tar.gz'.  You need to unpack this file and compile the results
with a C compiler.

   First, decide where you want to install the xboard executable
program and documentation.  The default is to put them under the
`/usr/local' directory tree.  If you want to put them somewhere else,
such as under your home directory, change the value in the `--prefix'
option below.

   Use the following commands:

     gzip -cd xboard-*.tar.gz | tar -xvf -
     cd xboard-*/
     configure --prefix=/usr/local
     make
     make install

   If you have any problems with these steps, see the file `INSTALL' in
the XBoard distribution for detailed instructions on options you can
give to `configure', and see the file `FAQ' for answers to frequently
asked questions.

   If everything works, you can delete the whole `xboard-*' directory
after `make install' is done.

Command options supported by XBoard
***********************************

   XBoard always runs in one of four major modes:

xboard [options]
     runs XBoard as an interface to a chess engine running on your
     machine, such as GNU Chess or Crafty. In this mode, XBoard lets
     you play a game against the chess engine, set up arbitrary
     positions, force variations, or watch a game between two chess
     engines.

xboard -ics -icshost hostname [options]
     runs XBoard as an interface to the Internet Chess Server (ICS).
     You can play against other ICS users, observe games they are
     playing, or review games that have recently finished. *Note ICS::.
     All the "wild" chess variants on ICS are supported, including
     bughouse.

xboard -ncp [options]
     lets you use XBoard as a simple chessboard to play through games.
     It will read and write game files and allow you to play through
     variations manually. You can use it to browse games off the net or
     review games you have saved.  These features are also available in
     the other modes.  If you want to pipe games into XBoard, use the
     supplied shell script `pxboard'.  For example, from the news
     reader `xrn', find a message with one or more games in it, click
     the Save button, and type `|pxboard' as the file name.

cmail
     uses XBoard as an interface to electronic mail correspondence
     chess.  *Note CMail::.

   Most of the XBoard options have both a long name and a short name.
To turn a boolean option on or off from the command line, either give
its long name followed by the value `true' or `false' (`-longOptionName
true'), or give just the short name to turn the option on (`-opt'), or
the short name preceded by `x' to turn the option off (`-xopt'). For
options that take strings or numbers as values, you can use the long or
short option names interchangeably.

   Each option corresponds to an X resource with the same name, so if
you like, you can set options in your `.Xdefaults' file or in a file
named `XBoard' in your home directory.  For options that have two
names, the longer one is the name of the corresponding X resource; the
short name is not recognized.  To turn a boolean option on or off as an
X resource, give its long name followed by the value `true' or `false':

     XBoard*longOptionName: true

* Menu:

* Chess engine options::        Controlling the chess engine.
* ICS options::                 Connecting to and using ICS.
* I/O options::                 Load and Save options.
* User interface options::      Look and Feel options.
* Other options::               Miscellaneous.

Controlling the chess engine
============================

-tc or -timeControl minutes[:seconds]
     Each player begins with his clock set to the `timeControl' period.
     Default: 5 minutes.  The additional options `movesPerSession' and
     `timeIncrement' are mutually exclusive.

-mps or -movesPerSession moves
     When both players have made `movesPerSession' moves, a new
     `timeControl' period is added to both clocks.  Default: 40 moves.

-inc or -timeIncrement seconds
     If this option is specified, `movesPerSession' is ignored.
     Instead, after each player's move, `timeIncrement' seconds are
     added to his clock.  Use `-inc 0' if you want to require the entire
     game to be played in one `timeControl' period, with no increment.
     Default: -1, which specifies `movesPerSession' mode.

-clock/-xclock or -clockMode True/False
     Determines whether or not to display the chess clocks. If
     clockMode is `false', the clocks are not shown, but the side that
     is to play next is still highlighted. Also, unless `searchTime' is
     set, the chess engine still keeps track of the clock time and uses
     it to determine how fast to make its moves.

-st or -searchTime minutes[:seconds]
     Tells the chess engine to spend at most the given amount of time
     searching for each of its moves. Without this option, the chess
     engine chooses its search time based on the number of moves and
     amount of time remaining until the next time control.  Setting
     this option also sets `clockMode' to false.

-depth or -searchDepth number
     Tells the chess engine to look ahead at most the given number of
     moves when searching for a move to make. Without this option, the
     chess engine chooses its search depth based on the number of moves
     and amount of time remaining until the next time control.  With
     the option, the engine will cut off its search early if it reaches
     the specified depth.

-thinking/-xthinking or -showThinking True/False
     Sets the Show Thinking option. *Note Options Menu::. Default:
     false.

-ponder/-xponder or -ponderNextMove True/False
     Sets the Ponder Next Move menu option. *Note Options Menu::.
     Default: True.

-mg or -matchGames n
     Automatically runs an n-game match between two chess engines, with
     alternating colors.  If the `loadGameFile' or `loadPositionFile'
     option is set, XBoard starts each game with the given opening
     moves or the given position; otherwise, the games start with the
     standard initial chess position.  If the `saveGameFile' option is
     set, a move record for the match is appended to the specified
     file. If the `savePositionFile' option is set, the final position
     reached in each game of the match is appended to the specified
     file. When the match is over, XBoard displays the match score and
     exits. Default: 0 (do not run a match).

-mm/-xmm or -matchMode True/False
     Abbreviation for -matchGames 1.

-fcp or -firstChessProgram program
     Name of first chess engine.  Default: `gnuchessx'.

-scp or -secondChessProgram program
     Name of second chess engine, if needed.  A second chess engine is
     started only in Two Machines (match) mode.  Default: `gnuchessx'.

-fb/-xfb or -firstPlaysBlack True/False
     In games between two chess engines, firstChessProgram normally
     plays white.  (This is a change from earlier versions of XBoard.)
     If this option is True, firstChessProgram plays black.  In a
     multi-game match, this option affects the colors only for the
     first game; they still alternate in subsequent games.

-fh or -firstHost host
-sh or -secondHost host
     Hosts on which the chess engines are to run. The default for each
     is `localhost'. If you specify another host, XBoard uses `rsh' (1)
     to run the chess engine there. (You can substitute a different
     remote shell program for rsh using the `remoteShell' option
     described below.)

-fd or -firstDirectory dir

-sd or -secondDirectory dir
     Working directories in which the chess engines are to be run.  The
     default is "", which means to run the chess engine in the same
     working directory as XBoard itself.  (See the CHESSDIR environment
     variable.)  This option is effective only when the chess engine is
     being run on the local host; it does not work if the engine is run
     remotely using the -fh or -sh option.

-initString string

-secondInitString string
     The string that is sent to initialize each chess engine for a new
     game.  Default:

          new
          random

     Setting this option from the command line is tricky, because you
     must type in real newline characters, including one at the very
     end.  In most shells you can do this by entering a `\' character
     followed by a newline. It is easier to set the option from your
     `.Xdefaults' file; in that case you can include the character
     sequence `\n' in the string, and it will be converted to a newline.

     If you change this option, don't remove the `new' command; it is
     required by all chess engines to start a new game.

     You can remove the `random' command if you like; including it
     causes GNU Chess to randomize its move selection slightly so that
     it doesn't play the same moves in every game.  Even without
     `random', GNU Chess randomizes its choice of moves from its
     opening book.  Crafty ignores this command; it randomizes by
     default.

     You can also try adding other commands to the initString; see the
     GNU Chess or Crafty documentation for details.

-reuse/-xreuse or -reuseFirst True/False

-reuse2/-xreuse2 or -reuseSecond True/False
     If the option is false, XBoard kills off the chess engine after
     every game and starts it again for the next game.  If the option
     is true (the default), XBoard starts the chess engine only once
     and uses it repeatedly to play multiple games.  Some chess engines
     may not work properly when reuse is turned on, such as versions of
     Crafty earlier than 12.0, but otherwise new games will start
     faster if it is left on.

Connecting to and using ICS
===========================

-ics/-xics or -internetChessServerMode True/False
     Connect with an Internet Chess Server to play chess against its
     other users, observe games they are playing, or review games that
     have recently finished. Default: false.  To use XBoard in ICS
     mode, run it in the foreground, and use the terminal you started
     it from to type commands and receive text responses from the chess
     server.  *Note ICS::. *Note File Menu::. *Note Step Menu::.  *Note
     Mode Menu::.

-icshost or -internetChessServerHost host
     The Internet host name or address of the chess server to connect
     to when in ICS mode. Default: `chessclub.com'. See the file
     `ics-addresses' in the XBoard distribution for a list of other
     addresses to try.  If your site doesn't have a working Internet
     name server, try specifying the host address in numeric form.  You
     may also need to specify the numeric address when using the
     icshelper option with timestamp or timeseal (see below).  At this
     writing `chessclub.com' is `207.99.5.190' and `freechess.org' is
     `164.58.253.13'.

-icsport or -internetChessServerPort port-number
     The port number to use when connecting to a chess server in ICS
     mode. Default: 5000.

-icshelper or -internetChessServerHelper prog-name
     An external helper program used to communicate with the chess
     server.  You would set it to "timestamp" for ICC (chessclub.com) or
     "timeseal" for FICS (freechess.org, eics.daimi.aau.dk, etc.), after
     obtaining the correct version of timestamp or timeseal for your
     computer.  See "help timestamp" on ICC and "help timeseal" on FICS.
     This option is shorthand for `-useTelnet -telnetProgram program'.

-telnet/-xtelnet or -useTelnet True/False
     This option is poorly named; it should be called useHelper.  If
     set to true, it instructs XBoard to run an external program to
     communicate with the Internet Chess Server.  The program to use is
     given by the telnetProgram option.  If the option is false (the
     default), XBoard opens a TCP socket and uses its own internal
     implementation of the telnet protocol to communicate with the ICS.
     *Note Firewalls::.

-telnetProgram prog-name
     This option is poorly named; it should be called helperProgram.
     It gives the name of the telnet program to be used with the
     `gateway' and `useTelnet' options.  The default is `telnet'. The
     telnet program is invoked with the value of
     `internetChessServerHost' as its first argument and the value of
     `internetChessServerPort' as its second argument.  *Note
     Firewalls::.

-gateway host-name
     If this option is set to a host name, XBoard uses `rsh' (1) to run
     the `telnet' (1) program on the given host to communicate with the
     Internet Chess Server instead of using its own internal
     implementation of the telnet protocol. You can substitute a
     different remote shell program for `rsh' using the `remoteShell'
     option described below.  *Note Firewalls::.

-internetChessServerCommPort or -icscomm dev-name
     If this option is set, XBoard communicates with the ICS through
     the given character I/O device instead of opening a TCP connection.
     Use this option if your system does not have any kind of Internet
     connection itself (not even a SLIP or PPP connection), but you do
     have dialup access (or a hardwired terminal line) to an Internet
     service provider from which you can telnet to the ICS.

     The support for this option in XBoard is minimal. You need to set
     all communication parameters and tty modes before you enter XBoard.

     Use a script something like this:

          stty raw -echo 9600 > /dev/tty00
          xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/tty00

     Here replace `/dev/tty00' with the name of the device that your
     modem is connected to. You might have to add several more options
     to these stty commands. See the man pages for `stty' (1) and `tty'
     (4) if you run into problems. Also, on many systems stty works on
     its standard input instead of standard output, so you have to use
     `<' instead of `>'.

     If you are using linux, try starting with the script below.
     Change it as necessary for your installation.

          ####################################################
          #!/bin/sh -f
          # configure modem and fire up XBoard
          
          # configure modem
          (
            stty 2400 ; stty raw ; stty hupcl ; stty -clocal
            stty ignbrk ; stty ignpar ; stty ixon ; stty ixoff
            stty -iexten ; stty -echo
          ) < /dev/modem
          xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/modem
          ####################################################

     After you start XBoard in this way, type whatever commands are
     necessary to dial out to your Internet provider and log in.  Then
     telnet to ICS, using a command like

          telnet chessclub.com 5000

     Important: See the paragraph below about extra echoes, in *Note
     Limitations::.

-icslogon or -internetChessServerLogonScript file-name
     Whenever XBoard connects to the Internet Chess Server, if it finds
     a file with the name given in this option, it feeds the file's
     contents to the ICS as commands. The default file name is `.icsrc'.
     Usually the first two lines of the file should be your ICS user
     name and password.  The file can be either in $CHESSDIR, in
     XBoard's working directory if CHESSDIR is not set, or in your home
     directory.

-msLoginDelay delay
     If you experience trouble logging on to an ICS when using the
     `-icslogon' option, inserting some delay between characters of the
     logon script may help. This option adds `delay' milliseconds of
     delay between characters. Good values to try are 100 and 250.

-icsinput/-xicsinput or -internetChessServerInputBox True/False
     Sets the ICS Input Box menu option. *Note Mode Menu::. Default:
     false.

-autocomm/-xautocomm or -autoComment True/False
     Sets the Auto Comment menu option. *Note Options Menu::. Default:
     False.

-autoflag/-xautoflag or -autoCallFlag True/False
     Sets the Auto Flag menu option.  *Note Options Menu::. Default:
     false.

-autobs/-xautobs or -autoObserve True/False
     Sets the Auto Observe menu option.  *Note Options Menu::. Default:
     false.

-moves/-xmoves or -getMoveList True/False
     Sets the Get Move List menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.
     Default: false.

-quiet/-xquiet or -quietPlay True/False
     Sets the Quiet Play menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.  Default:
     false.

-colorizeMessages or -colorize
     Setting colorizeMessages to True tells XBoard to colorize the
     messages received from the ICS.  Colorization works only if your
     xterm supports ISO 6429 escape sequences for changing text colors.

-colorShout foreground,background,bold

-colorSShout foreground,background,bold

-colorChannel1 foreground,background,bold

-colorChannel foreground,background,bold

-colorKibitz foreground,background,bold

-colorTell foreground,background,bold

-colorChallege foreground,background,bold

-colorRequest foreground,background,bold

-colorSeek foreground,background,bold

-colorNormal foreground,background,bold
     These options set the colors used when colorizing ICS messages.
     All ICS messages are grouped into one of these categories: shout,
     sshout, channel 1, other channel, kibitz, tell, challenge, request
     (including abort, adjourn, draw, pause, and takeback), or normal
     (all other messages).

     Each foreground or background argument can be one of the following:
     black, red, green, yellow, blue, magenta, cyan, white, or default.
     Here "default" means the default foreground or background color of
     your xterm.  Bold can be 1 or 0.  If background is omitted,
     "default" is assumed; if bold is omitted, 0 is assumed.

     Here is an example of how to set the colors in your `.Xdefaults'
     file.  The colors shown here are the default values; you will get
     them if you turn `-colorize' on without specifying your own colors.
              xboard*colorizeMessages: true
              xboard*colorShout: green
              xboard*colorSShout: green, black, 1
              xboard*colorChannel1: cyan
              xboard*colorChannel: cyan, black, 1
              xboard*colorKibitz: magenta, black, 1
              xboard*colorTell: yellow, black, 1
              xboard*colorChallenge: red, black, 1
              xboard*colorRequest: red
              xboard*colorSeek: blue
              xboard*colorNormal: default

Load and Save options
=====================

-lgf or -loadGameFile file
-lgi or -loadGameIndex index
     If the `loadGameFile' option is set, XBoard loads the specified
     game file at startup. The file name `-' specifies the standard
     input. If there is more than one game in the file, XBoard pops up
     a menu of the available games, with entries based on their PGN
     tags.  If the `loadGameIndex' option is set to `N', the menu is
     suppressed and the N th game found in the file is loaded
     immediately.  The menu is also suppressed if `matchMode' is
     enabled or if the game file is a pipe; in these cases the first
     game in the file is loaded immediately.  Use the `pxboard' shell
     script provided with XBoard if you want to pipe in files
     containing multiple games and still see the menu.

-td or -timeDelay seconds
     Time delay between moves during `Load Game'. Fractional seconds
     are allowed; try `-td 0.4'. A time delay value of -1 tells XBoard
     not to step through game files automatically. Default: 1 second.

-sgf or -saveGameFile file
     If this option is set, XBoard appends a record of every game
     played to the specified file. The file name `-' specifies the
     standard output.

-autosave/-xautosave or -autoSaveGames True/False
     Sets the Auto Save menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.  Default:
     false.  Ignored if `saveGameFile' is set.

-lpf or -loadPositionFile file
-lpi or -loadPositionIndex index
     If the `loadPositionFile' option is set, XBoard loads the
     specified position file at startup. The file name `-' specifies the
     standard input. If the `loadPositionIndex' option is set to N, the
     Nth position found in the file is loaded; otherwise the first
     position is loaded.

-spf or -savePositionFile file
     If this option is set, XBoard appends the final position reached
     in every game played to the specified file. The file name `-'
     specifies the standard output.

-oldsave/-xoldsave or -oldSaveStyle True/False
     Sets the Old Save Style menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.
     Default: false.


File: xboard.info,  Node: User interface options,  Next: Other options,  Prev: I/O options,  Up: Invocation

Look and Feel options
=====================

-display
-geometry
-iconic
     These are just the standard Xt options accepted by XBoard.

-bell/-xbell or -ringBellAfterMoves True/False
     Sets the Bell menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.  Default: false.

-exit/-xexit or -popupExitMessage True/False
     Sets the Popup Exit Message menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.
     Default: True.

-popup/-xpopup or -popupMoveErrors True/False
     Sets the Popup Move Errors menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.
     Default: False.

-queen/-xqueen or -alwaysPromoteToQueen True/False
     Sets the Always Queen menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.
     Default: false.

-legal/-xlegal or -testLegality True/False
     If this option is true (the default), XBoard tests whether moves
     you try to make with the mouse are legal, and refuses to let you
     make an illegal move.  Moves loaded from a file with `Load Game'
     are also checked.  If the option is false, all moves are accepted.
     If GNU Chess, Crafty, or the ICS is active, they will still reject
     illegal moves.  Turning off this option is useful if you are
     playing a chess variant with rules that XBoard does not understand.

-size or -boardSize (sizeName | n1,n2,n3,n4,n5,n6,n7)
     Determines how large the board will be, by selecting the pixel size
     of the pieces and setting a few related parameters.  The sizeName
     can be one of: Titanic, giving 129x129 pixel pieces, Colossal
     116x116, Giant 108x108, Huge 95x95, Big 87x87, Large 80x80, Bulky
     72x72, Medium 64x64, Moderate 58x58, Average 54x54, Middling
     49x49, Mediocre 45x45, Small 40x40, Slim 37x37, Petite 33x33,
     Dinky 29x29, Teeny 25x25, or Tiny 21x21.  Piece bitmaps of all
     these sizes are built into XBoard.  The default depends on the
     size of your screen; it is approximately the largest size that
     will fit without clipping.

     You can select other sizes or vary other layout parameters by
     providing a list of comma-separated values (with no spaces) as the
     argument.  You do not need to provide all the values; for any you
     omit from the end of the list, defaults are taken from the nearest
     built-in size.  The value `n1' gives the piece size, `n2' the
     width of the black border between squares, `n3' the desired size
     for the clockFont, `n4' the desired size for the coordFont, `n5'
     the desired size for the default font, `n6' the smallLayout flag
     (0 or 1), and `n7' the tinyLayout flag (0 or 1).  All dimensions
     are in pixels.  If smallLayout is 1 and `titleInWindow' is True,
     the window layout is rearranged to make more room for the title.
     If tinyLayout is 1, the labels on the menu bar are abbreviated to
     one character each and the buttons in the button bar are made
     narrower.

-coords/-xcoords or -showCoords True/False
     Sets the Show Coords menu option.  *Note Options Menu::.  Default:
     false.  The `coordFont' option specifies what font to use.

-flip/-xflip or -flipView True/False
     If you are playing a game on the ICS, the board is always oriented
     at the start of the game so that your pawns move from the bottom
     of the window towards the top.  Otherwise, the starting
     orientation is determined by the flipView option; if it is false
     (the default), White's pawns move from bottom to top at the start
     of each game; if it is true, Black's pawns move from bottom to top.

-title/-xtitle or -titleInWindow True/False
     If this option is true, XBoard displays player names (for ICS
     games) and game file names (for `Load Game') inside its main
     window. If the option is false (the default), this information is
     displayed only in the window banner. You probably won't want to
     set this option unless the information is not showing up in the
     banner, as happens with a few X window managers.

-mono/-xmono or -monoMode True/False
     Determines whether XBoard displays its pieces and squares with two
     colors (true) or four (false). You shouldn't have to specify
     `monoMode'; XBoard will determine if it is necessary.

-flashCount count

-flashRate rate

-flash

-xflash
     These options enable flashing of pieces when they land on their
     destination square.  `flashCount' tells XBoard how many times to
     flash a piece after it lands on its destination square.
     `flashRate' controls the rate of flashing (flashes/sec).
     Abbreviations: `flash' sets flashCount to 3.  `xflash' sets
     flashCount to 0.  Defaults:  flashCount=0 (no flashing),
     flashRate=5.

-highlight/-xhighlight or -highlightLastMove True/False
     Sets the Highlight Last Move menu option. Default: False.

-clockFont font
     The font used for the clocks. If the option value is a pattern
     that does not specify the font size, XBoard tries to choose an
     appropriate font for the board size being used.  Default:
     -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.

-coordFont font
     The font used for rank and file coordinate labels if `showCoords'
     is true. If the option value is a pattern that does not specify
     the font size, XBoard tries to choose an appropriate font for the
     board size being used.  Default:
     -*-helvetica-bold-r-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.

-font font
     The font used for popup dialogs, menus, comments, etc.  If the
     option value is a pattern that does not specify the font size,
     XBoard tries to choose an appropriate font for the board size
     being used.  Default: -*-helvetica-medium-r-normal-*-*-*-*-*-*-*-*.

-fontSizeTolerance tol
     In the font selection algorithm, a nonscalable font will be
     preferred over a scalable font if the nonscalable font's size
     differs by tol pixels or less from the desired size.  A value of
     -1 will force a scalable font to always be used if available; a
     value of 0 will use a nonscalable font only if it is exactly the
     right size; a large value (say 1000) will force a nonscalable font
     to always be used if available.  Default: 4.

-bm or -bitmapDirectory dir
     By default, XBoard uses a set of compiled-in bitmaps for its
     pieces, icons, and menu checkmark.  If the `bitmapDirectory'
     option is set at runtime, bitmaps are taken from files in the
     specified directory.  If any bitmap file is missing or unusable,
     XBoard looks for a built-in bitmap of the required type and size
     instead.

     Files in the `bitmapDirectory' must be named as follows: The first
     character of a piece bitmap name gives the piece it represents
     (`p', `n', `b', `r', `q', or `k'), the next characters give the
     size in pixels, the following character indicates whether the
     piece is solid or outline (`s' or `o'), and the extension is `.bm'.
     For example, a solid 80x80 knight would be named `n80s.bm'.  The
     outline bitmaps are used only in monochrome mode.  The icons are
     named `icon_white.bm' and `icon_black.bm', and the menu checkmark
     is named `checkmark.bm'.

     Two sets of bitmaps are distributed with XBoard. Those in the
     directory `bitmaps' are normally compiled in as the default.
     Those in the `bitmaps.xchess' directory can be selected at runtime
     with the `bitmapDirectory' option. If you want to compile in the
     latter set as the default, rename the `bitmaps' directory to
     `bitmaps.fselch' and the `bitmaps.xchess' directory to `bitmaps';
     then recompile XBoard.  If you want to add another compiled-in
     size, edit the `bitmaps.h' file in the bitmaps directory, and
     optionally edit `xboard.h' to associate a name and default layout
     parameters with your new size.

-xpm or -xpmDirectory dir
     Instead of bitmaps, XBoard can use X pixmaps as its piece images.
     If the xpmDirectory option is set, pixmaps are taken from files in
     the specified directory.  The directory may contain multiple sizes
     of pieces. XBoard will choose the closest based either on screen
     size or on the size option.

     You can also specify this option in your .Xdefaults file like this:

               xboard*xpmDirectory: ~/pieces

     For more information about XPM pieces, see *Note zic2xpm::

-whitePieceColor color

-blackPieceColor color

-lightSquareColor color

-darkSquareColor color

-highlightSquareColor color
     Colors to use for the pieces, squares, and square highlights.
     Defaults:
          -whitePieceColor      #FFFFCC
          -blackPieceColor      #202020
          -lightSquareColor     #C8C365
          -darkSquareColor      #77A26D
          -highlightSquareColor #FFFF00

     On a grayscale monitor you might prefer:
          -whitePieceColor      gray100
          -blackPieceColor      gray0
          -lightSquareColor     gray80
          -darkSquareColor      gray60
          -highlightSquareColor gray100

-drag/-xdrag or -animateDragging True/False
     Sets the Animate Dragging menu option. Default: True.

-animate/-xanimate or -animateMoving True/False
     Sets the Animate Moving menu option. Default: True.

-animateSpeed n
     Number of milliseconds delay between each animation frame when
     Animate Moves is on.

Miscellaneous
=============

-ncp/-xncp or -noChessProgram True/False
     If this option is true, XBoard acts as a passive chessboard; it
     does not start a chess engine at all. Turning on this option also
     turns off clockMode. Default: false.

-debug/-xdebug or -debugMode True/False
     Turns on debugging printout.

-rsh or -remoteShell shell-name
     Name of the command used to run programs remotely. The default is
     `rsh' or `remsh', determined when XBoard is configured and
     compiled.

-ruser or -remoteUser user-name
     User name on the remote system when running programs with the
     `remoteShell'. The default is your local user name.

Accessing external games and positions
======================================

Reset
     Resets XBoard and the chess engine to the beginning of a new chess
     game. The `r' key is a keyboard equivalent. In Internet Chess
     Server mode, clears the current state of XBoard, then
     resynchronizes with ICS by sending a refresh command. If you want
     to stop playing, observing, or examining a game on ICS, use an
     appropriate command from the Action menu, not `Reset'. *Note
     Action Menu::.

Load Game
     Plays a game from a record file. The `g' key is a keyboard
     equivalent.  A popup dialog prompts you for the file name. If the
     file contains more than one game, a second popup dialog displays a
     list of games (with information drawn from their PGN tags, if
     any), and you can select the one you want. Alternatively, you can
     load the Nth game in the file directly, by typing the number `N'
     after the file name, separated by a space.

     The game file parser will accept PGN (portable game notation), or
     in fact almost any file that contains moves in algebraic notation.
     Notation of the form `P@f7' is accepted for piece-drops in
     bughouse games; this is a nonstandard extension to PGN.  If the
     file includes a PGN position (FEN tag), or an XBoard position
     diagram bracketed by `[--' and `--]' before the first move, the
     game starts from that position. Text enclosed in parentheses,
     square brackets, or curly braces is assumed to be commentary and
     is displayed in a pop-up window. Any other text in the file is
     ignored. PGN variations (enclosed in parentheses) are treated as
     comments; XBoard is not able to walk variation trees.

Load Next Game
     Loads the next game from the last game record file you loaded.
     The shifted `N' key is a keyboard equivalent.  Not available if
     the last game was loaded from a pipe.

Load Previous Game
     Loads the previous game from the last game record file you loaded.
     The shifted `P' key is a keyboard equivalent.  Not available if
     the last game was loaded from a pipe.

Reload Same Game
     Reloads the last game you loaded.

Save Game
     Appends a record of the current game to a file.  A popup dialog
     prompts you for the file name. If the game did not begin with the
     standard starting position, the game file includes the starting
     position used. Games are saved in the PGN (portable game notation)
     format, unless the oldSaveStyle option is true, in which case they
     are saved in an older format that is specific to XBoard. Both
     formats are human-readable, and both can be read back by the `Load
     Game' command.  Notation of the form `P@f7' is accepted for
     piece-drops in bughouse games; this is a nonstandard extension to
     PGN.

Load Position
     Sets up a position from a position file.  A popup dialog prompts
     you for the file name. If the file contains more than one saved
     position, and you want to load the Nth one, type the number N
     after the file name, separated by a space. Position files must be
     in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation), or in the format that the Save
     Position command writes when oldSaveStyle is turned on.

Load Next Position
     Loads the next position from the last position file you loaded.
     Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe.

Load Previous Position
     Loads the previous position from the last position file you
     loaded.  Not available if the last position was loaded from a pipe.

Reload Same Position
     Reloads the last position you loaded.

Save Position
     Appends a diagram of the current position to a file.  A popup
     dialog prompts you for the file name. Positions are saved in FEN
     (Forsythe-Edwards notation) format unless the `oldSaveStyle'
     option is true, in which case they are saved in an older,
     human-readable format that is specific to XBoard. Both formats can
     be read back by the `Load Position' command.

Mail Move

Reload CMail Message
     See *Note CMail::.

Exit
     Exits from XBoard. The shifted `Q' key is a keyboard equivalent.


File: xboard.info,  Node: Mode Menu,  Next: Action Menu,  Prev: File Menu,  Up: Menus

Selecting XBoard's mode
=======================

Machine White
     Forces the chess engine to play White.

Machine Black
     Forces the chess engine to play Black.

Two Machines
     Plays a game between two chess engines.

Analysis Mode
     XBoard with Crafty only.  For information on getting Crafty, see
     *Note Crafty::.

     XBoard tells Crafty to start analyzing the current game/position
     and shows you the analysis as you move pieces around.

     To setup a position to analyze, you do the following:

     1. Select Edit Position from the Mode Menu

     2. Setup the position (use the right and middle buttons to bring
     up the Black/White piece menus).

     3. When you are finished, click on either the Black or White clock
     to tell XBoard which side moves first.

     4. Select Analysis Mode from the Mode Menu to start the analysis.

Analyze File
     XBoard with Crafty only.  For information on getting Crafty, see
     *Note Crafty::.

     This option lets you load a game from a file (PGN, XBoard format,
     etc.)  and analyze it. When you select this menu item, a popup
     window appears and asks for a filename to load.  If the file
     contains multiple games, another popup appears that lets you
     select which game you wish to analyze.  After a game is loaded,
     use the XBoard arrow buttons to step forwards/backwards through
     the game and watch Crafty's analysis.

ICS Client
     ICS mode only. Takes XBoard out of the Edit Game or Edit Position
     state.

     While you are examining a game on the ICS, you can issue the ICS
     position-editing commands with the mouse. Do this with `ICS
     Client' selected on the Mode menu, not `Edit Position'; the latter
     edits only your local copy of the position.

     To drop a new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over
     the square. This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or
     black pieces (button 3).  Additional menu choices let you empty
     the square or clear the board.  You cannot set the side to play or
     drag pieces to arbitrary squares while examining on ICS, however;
     the ICS permits only legal moves in this mode.

     If you are playing a bughouse game on the ICS, you can drop an
     offboard piece by pressing mouse button 2 or 3 over an empty
     square to bring up a piece menu.  It makes no difference which
     button you use.  A list of the offboard pieces each player has
     available is shown in the window title after the player's name.

Edit Game
     Allows you to make moves for both Black and White, and to change
     moves after backing up with the `Backward' command. The clocks do
     not run.

     In GNU Chess mode, the chess engine continues to check moves for
     legality but does not participate in the game. You can bring the
     chess engine into the game by selecting `Machine White', `Machine
     Black', or `Two Machines'.

     In ICS mode, the moves are not sent to the ICS: `Edit Game' takes
     XBoard out of ICS Client mode and lets you edit games locally.  If
     you want to edit games on ICS in a way that other ICS users can
     see, use the ICS examine command or start an ICS match against
     yourself.

Edit Position
     Lets you set up an arbitrary board position.  Use mouse button 1
     to drag pieces to new squares, or to delete a piece by dragging it
     off the board or dragging an empty square on top of it.  To drop a
     new piece on a square, press mouse button 2 or 3 over the square.
     This brings up a menu of white pieces (button 2) or black pieces
     (button 3). Additional menu choices let you empty the square or
     clear the board. You can set the side to play next by clicking on
     the White or Black indicator at the top of the screen.  Selecting
     `Edit Position' causes XBoard to discard all remembered moves in
     the current game.

     In ICS mode, changes made to the position by `Edit Position' are
     not sent to the ICS: `Edit Position' takes XBoard out of `ICS
     Client' mode and lets you edit positions locally. If you want to
     edit positions on ICS in a way that other ICS users can see, use
     the `ICS examine' command, or start an ICS match against yourself.
     (See also the ICS Client topic above.)

Show Game List
     Shows or hides the list of games generated by the last `Load Game'
     command.

Edit Tags
     Lets you edit the PGN (portable game notation) tags for the
     current game. After editing, the tags must still conform to the
     PGN tag syntax:

          <tag-section> ::= <tag-pair> <tag-section>
                                  <empty>
          <tag-pair> ::= [ <tag-name> <tag-value> ]
          <tag-name> ::= <identifier>
          <tag-value> ::= <string>

     See the PGN Standard for full details. Here is an example:

          [Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
          [Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
          [Date "1958.08.16"]
          [Round "8"]
          [White "Robert J. Fischer"]
          [Black "Bent Larsen"]
          [Result "1-0"]

     Any characters that do not match this syntax are silently ignored.
     Note that the PGN standard requires all games to have at least the
     seven tags shown above. Any that you omit will be filled in by
     XBoard with `?' (unknown value), or `-' (inapplicable value).

Edit Comment
     Adds or modifies a comment on the current position. Comments are
     saved by `Save Game' and are displayed by `Load Game', `Forward',
     and `Backward'.

ICS Input Box
     If this option is set in ICS mode, XBoard creates an extra window
     that you can use for typing in ICS commands.  The input box is
     especially useful if you want to type in something long or do some
     editing on your input, because output from ICS doesn't get mixed
     in with your typing as it would in the main terminal window.

Pause
     Pauses updates to the board, and if you are playing against a
     chess engine, also pauses your clock. To continue, select `Pause'
     again, and the display will automatically update to the latest
     position.  The `P' button and keyboard `p' key are equivalents.

     If you select Pause when you are playing against a chess engine and
     it is not your move, the chess engine's clock will continue to run
     and it will eventually make a move, at which point both clocks
     will stop. Since board updates are paused, however, you will not
     see the move until you exit from Pause mode (or select Forward).
     This behavior is meant to simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

     If you select Pause while you are in `examine' mode on ICS, you
     can step backward and forward in the current history of the
     examined game without affecting the other observers and examiners.
     Select Pause again to reconnect yourself to the current state of
     the game on ICS.

     If you select `Pause' while you are loading a game, the game stops
     loading. You can load more moves manually by selecting `Forward',
     or resume automatic loading by selecting `Pause' again.

Talking to GNU chess or ICS opponents
=====================================

Accept
     Accepts a pending match offer. If there is more than one offer
     pending, you will have to type in a more specific command instead
     of using this menu choice. ICS mode only.

Decline
     Declines a pending offer (match, draw, adjourn, etc.). If there is
     more than one offer pending, you will have to type in a more
     specific command instead of using this menu choice. ICS mode only.

Call Flag
     Calls your opponent's flag, claiming a win on time, or claiming a
     draw if you are both out of time. You can also call your
     opponent's flag by clicking on his clock or by pressing the
     keyboard `t' key.

Draw
     Offers a draw to your opponent, accepts a pending draw offer from
     your opponent, or claims a draw by repetition or the 50-move rule,
     as appropriate. The `d' key is a keyboard equivalent.  Not
     available in GNU Chess mode.

Adjourn
     Asks your opponent to agree to adjourning the current game, or
     agrees to a pending adjournment offer from your opponent. ICS mode
     only.

Abort
     Asks your opponent to agree to aborting the current game, or
     agrees to a pending abort offer from your opponent. An aborted
     game ends immediately without affecting either player's rating.

Resign
     Resigns the game to your opponent. The shifted `R' key is a
     keyboard equivalent.

Stop Observing
     Ends your participation in observing a game, by issuing the ICS
     observe command with no arguments. ICS mode only.

Stop Examining
     Ends your participation in examining a game, by issuing the ICS
     unexamine command. ICS mode only.

Controlling the game
====================

Backward
     Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.  The `[<]'
     button and the `b' key are equivalents.  In addition, pressing the
     Control key steps back one move, and releasing it steps forward
     again.

     In most modes, `Backward' only lets you look back at old positions;
     it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are playing
     against a chess engine, playing or observing a game on the ICS, or
     loading a game.  If you select `Backward' in any of these
     situations, you will not be allowed to make a different move. Use
     `Retract Move' or `Edit Game' if you want to change past moves.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of `Backward'
     depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is off,
     `Backward' issues the ICS backward command, which backs up
     everyone's view of the game and allows you to make a different
     move. If Pause mode is on, `Backward' only backs up your local
     view.

Forward
     Steps forward through a series of remembered moves (undoing the
     effect of `Backward') or forward through a game file. The `[>]'
     button and the `f' key are equivalents.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of Forward
     depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is off,
     `Forward' issues the ICS forward command, which moves everyone's
     view of the game forward along the current line. If Pause mode is
     on, `Forward' only moves your local view forward, and it will not
     go past the position that the game was in when you paused.

Back to Start
     Jumps backward to the first remembered position in the game.  The
     `[<<]' button and the shifted `B' key are equivalents.

     In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back at old
     positions; it does not retract moves. This is the case if you are
     playing against GNU chess, playing or observing a game on the ICS,
     or loading a game. If you select `Back to Start' in any of these
     situations, you will not be allowed to make different moves. Use
     `Retract Move' or `Edit Game' if you want to change past moves; or
     use Reset to start a new game.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of `Back to
     Start' depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode
     is off, `Back to Start' issues the ICS `backward 999999' command,
     which backs up everyone's view of the game to the start and allows
     you to make different moves. If Pause mode is on, `Back to Start'
     only backs up your local view.

Forward to End
     Jumps forward to the last remembered position in the game. The
     `[>>]' button and the shifted `F' key are equivalents.

     If you are examining a game on ICS, the behavior of `Forward to
     End' depends on whether XBoard is in Pause mode. If Pause mode is
     off, `Forward to End' issues the ICS `forward 999999' command,
     which moves everyone's view of the game forward to the end of the
     current line. If Pause mode is on, `Forward to End' only moves
     your local view forward, and it will not go past the position that
     the game was in when you paused.

Revert
     If you are examining a game on ICS and Pause mode is off, issues
     the ICS command `revert'.

Truncate Game
     Discards all remembered moves of the game beyond the current
     position. Puts XBoard into `Edit Game' mode if it was not there
     already.

Move Now
     Forces the chess engine to move immediately. GNU Chess mode only.

Retract Move
     Retracts your last move. In GNU Chess mode, you can do this only
     after the chess engine has replied to your move; if the chess
     engine is still thinking, use `Move Now' first. In ICS mode,
     `Retract Move' issues the command `takeback 1' or `takeback 2'
     depending on whether it is your opponent's move or yours.

User Preferences
================

Always Queen
     If this option is off, XBoard brings up a dialog box whenever you
     move a pawn to the last rank, asking what piece you want to
     promote it to. If the option is true, your pawns are always
     promoted to queens. Your opponent can still underpromote, however.

Animate Dragging
     If Animate Dragging is on, while you are dragging a piece with the
     mouse, an image of the piece follows the mouse cursor.  If Animate
     Dragging is off, there is no visual feedback while you are
     dragging a piece, but if Animate Moving is on, the move will be
     animated when it is complete.

Animate Moving
     If Animate Moving is on, all piece moves are animated.  An image
     of the piece is shown moving from the old square to the new square
     when the move is completed (unless the move was already animated
     by Animate Dragging).  If Animate Moving is off, a moved piece
     instantly disappears from its old square and reappears on its new
     square when the move is complete.

Auto Comment
     If this option is on, any remarks made on ICS while you are
     observing or playing a game are recorded as a comment on the
     current move.  This includes remarks made with the ICS commands
     `say', `tell', `whisper', and `kibitz'.  Limitation: remarks that
     you type yourself are not recognized; XBoard scans only the output
     from ICS, not the input you type to it.

Auto Flag
     If this option is on and one player runs out of time before the
     other, XBoard will automatically call his flag, claiming a win on
     time.  In ICS mode, Auto Flag will only call your opponent's flag,
     not yours, and the ICS may award you a draw instead of a win if
     you have insufficient mating material.  In local chess engine mode,
     {No value for `xboard'} may call either player's flag and will not
     take material into account.

Auto Observe
     If this option is on and you add a player to your `gnotify' list
     on ICS, XBoard will automatically observe all of that player's
     games, unless you are doing something else (such as observing or
     playing a game of your own) when one starts.  The games are
     displayed from the point of view of the player on your gnotify
     list; that is, his pawns move from the bottom of the window
     towards the top.  Exceptions:  If both players in a game are on
     your gnotify list, if your ICS `highlight' variable is set to 0,
     or if the ICS you are using does not properly support observing
     from Black's point of view, you will see the game from White's
     point of view.

Auto Save
     If this option is true, at the end of every game XBoard prompts
     you for a file name and appends a record of the game to the file
     you specify.  Disabled if the `saveGameFile' command-line option
     is set, as in that case all games are saved to the specified file.
     *Note I/O options::.

Bell
     If this option is on, XBoard alerts you by ringing the terminal
     bell after each of your opponent's moves (or after every move if
     you are observing a game on the Internet Chess Server).  The bell
     is not rung after moves you make or moves read from a saved game
     file.

     If you turn on the bell when using XBoard with the Internet Chess
     Server, you will probably want to give the

          set bell 0

     command to the ICS, since otherwise the ICS will ring the bell
     itself after every move (not just yours). (The `.icsrc' file is a
     good place for this, *note ICS options::)

Flash Moves
     If this option is on, whenever a move is completed, the moved
     piece flashes.  The number of times to flash is set by the
     flashCount command-line option; it defaults to 3 if Flash Moves is
     first turned on from the menu.

Flip View
     Inverts your view of the chess board for the duration of the
     current game. Starting a new game returns the board to normal.
     The `v' key is a keyboard equivalent.

     If you are playing a game on the ICS, the board is always oriented
     at the start of the game so that your pawns move from the bottom
     of the window towards the top. Otherwise, the starting orientation
     is determined by the `flipView' command line option; if it is
     false (the default), White's pawns move from bottom to top at the
     start of each game; if it is true, Black's pawns move from bottom
     to top. *Note User interface options::.

Highlight Last Move
     If Highlight Last Move is on, after a move is made, the starting
     and ending squares remain highlighted. In addition, after you use
     Backward or Back to Start, the starting and ending squares of the
     last move to be unmade are highlighted.

Get Move List
     If this option is on, whenever XBoard receives the first board of
     a new game (or a different game from the one it is currently
     displaying), it retrieves the list of past moves from the ICS.
     You can then review the moves with the `Forward' and `Backward'
     commands or save them with `Save Game'.  You might want to turn
     off this option if you are observing several blitz games at once,
     to keep from wasting time and network bandwidth fetching the move
     lists over and over.  When you turn this option on from the menu,
     XBoard immediately fetches the move list of the current game (if
     any).

Old Save Style
     If this option is off, XBoard saves games in PGN (portable game
     notation) and positions in FEN (Forsythe-Edwards notation).  If
     the option is on, a save style that is compatible with older
     versions of XBoard is used instead.  The old position style is
     more human-readable than FEN; the old game style has no particular
     advantages.

Periodic Updates
     If this option is off (or if you are using a chess engine that
     does not support periodic updates), the analysis window will only
     be updated when the analysis changes. If this option is on, the
     Analysis Window will be updated every two seconds.

Ponder Next Move
     If this option is off, the chess engine will think only when it is
     on move.  If the option is on, the engine will also think while
     waiting for you to make your move.

Popup Exit Message
     If this option is on, when XBoard wants to display a message just
     before exiting, it brings up a modal dialog box and waits for you
     to click OK before exiting.  If the option is off, XBoard prints
     the message to standard error (the terminal) and exits immediately.

Popup Move Errors
     If this option is off, when you make an error in moving (such as
     attempting an illegal move or moving the wrong color piece), the
     error message is displayed in the message area.  If the option is
     on, move errors are displayed in small popup windows like other
     errors.  You can dismiss an error popup either by clicking its OK
     button or by clicking anywhere on the board, including
     downclicking to start a move.

Quiet Play
     If this option is on, XBoard will automatically issue an ICS

          set shout 0

     command whenever you start a game and a

          set shout 1

     command whenever you finish one.  Thus, you will not be distracted
     by shouts from other ICS users while playing.

Show Coords
     If this option is on, XBoard displays algebraic coordinates along
     the board's left and bottom edges.

Show Thinking
     If this option is set, the chess engine's notion of the score and
     best line of play from the current position is displayed as it is
     thinking. The score indicates how many pawns ahead (or if negative,
     behind) the chess engine thinks it is. In matches between two
     machines, the score is prefixed by `W' or `B' to indicate whether
     it is showing White's thinking or Black's.

     you must have the GNU info program installed on your system, and
     the file `xboard.info' must either be present in the current
     working directory, or have been installed by the `make install'
     command when you built XBoard.

Man XBoard
     Displays the XBoard man page in a new window.  For this feature to
     work, the file `xboard.6' must have been installed by the `make

Other shortcut keys
===================

Iconize
     Pressing the `i' or `c' key iconizes XBoard. The graphical icon
     displays a white knight if it is white's move, or a black knight,
     if it is Black's move. If your X window manager displays only text
     icons, not graphical ones, check its documentation; there is
     probably a way to enable graphical icons. If you are running the
     Motif window manager `mwm' (1), add these lines to your
     `.Xdefaults' file and restart mwm:

          Mwm*iconDecoration: activelabel label image
          Mwm*XBoard*iconImageBackground: White
          Mwm*XBoard*iconImageForeground: Black

     The first line above enables graphical icons in mwm; you don't
     need it if you already have them. The next two lines force the
     white knights to come out white and the black knights black.
     Unfortunately these resources can't be set from inside XBoard; you
     have to set them in your `.Xdefaults' file.

   You can add or remove shortcut keys using the X resources
`form.translations'. Here is an example of what would go in your
`.Xdefaults' file:

     XBoard*form.translations: Shift<Key>?: AboutGameProc() \n\
     <Key>y: AcceptProc() \n\
     <Key>n: DeclineProc() \n\
     <Key>i: NothingProc()

Binding a key to `NothingProc' makes it do nothing, thus removing it as
a shortcut key. The XBoard commands that can be bound to keys are:

     AbortProc, AboutGameProc, AboutProc, AcceptProc, AdjournProc,
     AlwaysQueenProc, AnalysisModeProc, AnalyzeFileProc, AnimateDraggingProc,

Using XBoard with an Internet Chess Server (ICS)
************************************************

   An "Internet Chess Server", or "ICS", is a place on the Internet
where people can get together to play chess, watch other people's
games, or just chat.  You can use either `telnet' or a client program
like XBoard to connect to the server.  ICS is getting more and more
important for chess players: There are thousands of registered users on
the different ICS hosts, and it is not unusual to meet 200 on both ICC
and FICS.  The number is increasing rapidly.

   Most people can just type

     xboard -ics

to start XBoard as an ICS client.  Invoking XBoard in this way connects
you to the Internet Chess Club (ICC), a commercial ICS.  You can log in
there as a guest even if you do not have a paid account.  To connect to
the largest Free ICS (FICS), use the command

     xboard -ics -icshost freechess.org

instead, or substitute a different host name to connect to your
favorite ICS.  The `ics-addresses' in the XBoard distribution includes
a list of ICS hosts.  For a full description of command-line options
that control the connection to ICS and change the default values of ICS
options, see *Note ICS options::.

   While you are running XBoard as an ICS client, you use the terminal
window that you started XBoard from as a place to type in commands and
read information that is not available on the chessboard.

   The first time you need to use the terminal is to enter your login
name and password, if you are a registered player. (You don't need to do
this manually; the `icsLogon' option can do it for you.  *note ICS
options::)  If you are not registered, enter any name.  If someone has
already registered under that name, you'll be asked for a password;
just hit return and try again.  Or on ICC, you can enter `g' as your
name, and ICC will pick a unique (but boring) name for you.

   Some useful ICS commands include
`help <topic>'
     to get help on the given <topic>. To get a list of possible topics
     type "help" without topic.  Try the help command before you ask
     other people on the server for help.

     For example `help register' tells you how to become a registered
     ICS player.

`who <flags>'
     to see a list of people who are logged on.  Administrators (people
     you should talk to if you have a problem) are marked with the
     character `*', an asterisk. The <flags> allow you to display only
     selected players: For example, `who of' shows a list of players
     who are interested in playing but do not have an opponent.

`games'
     to see what games are being played

`match <player> [<mins>] [<inc>]'
     to challenge another player to a game. Both opponents get <mins>
     minutes for the game, and <inc> seconds will be added after each
     move.  If another player challenges you, the server asks if you
     want to accept the challenge; use the `accept' or `decline'
     commands to answer.

`accept'
`decline'
     to accept or decline another player's offer.  The offer may be to
     start a new game, or to agree to a `draw', `adjourn' or `abort'
     the current game. *Note Action Menu::.

     If you have more than one pending offer (for example, if more than
     one player is challenging you, or if your opponent offers both a
     draw and to adjourn the game), you have to supply additional
     information, by typing something like `accept <player>', `accept
     draw', or `draw'.

`draw'
`adjourn'
`abort'
     asks your opponent to terminate a game by mutual agreement.
     Adjourned games can be continued later.  Your opponent can either
     `decline' your offer or accept it (by typing the same command or
     typing `accept').  In some cases these commands work immediately,
     without asking your opponent to agree.  For example, you can abort
     the game unilaterally if your opponent is out of time, and you can
     claim a draw by repetition or the 50-move rule if available simply
     by typing `draw'.

`finger <player>'
     to get informations about the given <player>. (Default: yourself.)

`vars'
     to get a list of personal settings

`set <var> <value>'
     to modify these settings

`observe <player>'
     to observe an ongoing game of the given <player>.

`examine'
`oldmoves'
     to review a recently completed game

   Some special XBoard features are activated when you are in examine
mode on ICS.  See the descriptions of the menu commands `Forward',
`Backward', `Pause', `ICS Client', and `Stop Examining' on the *Note
Step Menu::, *Note Mode Menu::, and *Note Options Menu::.


File: xboard.info,  Node: Firewalls,  Next: Environment,  Prev: ICS,  Up: Top

Connecting to the ICS through a firewall
****************************************

   By default, XBoard communicates with an Internet Chess Server by
opening a TCP socket directly from the machine it is running on to the
ICS. If there is a firewall between your machine and the ICS, this
won't work. Here are some recipes for getting around common kinds of
firewalls using special options to XBoard.  Important: See the
paragraph in the below about extra echoes, in *Note Limitations::.

   Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can telnet to
a firewall host, log in, and then telnet from there to ICS.  Let's say
the firewall is called `fire.wall.com'. Set command-line options as
follows:

     xboard -ics -icshost fire.wall.com -icsport 23

Or in your `.Xdefaults' file:

     XBoard*internetChessServerHost: fire.wall.com
     XBoard*internetChessServerPort: 23

Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, you will be prompted to log in to
the firewall host. (This works because port 23 is the standard telnet
login service.) Do so, then telnet to ICS, using a command like `telnet
chessclub.com 5000', or whatever command the firewall provides for
telnetting to port 5000.

   If your firewall lets you telnet (or rlogin) to remote hosts, but
doesn't let you telnet to port 5000, you will have to find some other
host outside the firewall that does let you do this, and hop through
it. For instance, suppose you have an account at `foo.edu'. Follow the
recipe above, but instead of typing `telnet chessclub.com 5000' to the
firewall, type `telnet foo.edu' (or `rlogin foo.edu'), log in there, and
then type `telnet chessclub.com 5000'.

   Exception: chessclub.com itself lets you connect to the chess server
on the default telnet port (23), which is what you get if you don't
specify a port to the telnet program. But the other chess servers don't
allow this.

   Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but you can use rsh
to run programs on a firewall host, and that host can telnet to ICS.
Let's say the firewall is called `rsh.wall.com'. Set command-line
options as follows:

     xboard -ics -gateway rsh.wall.com -icshost chessclub.com

Or in your `.Xdefaults' file:

     XBoard*gateway: rsh.wall.com
     XBoard*internetChessServerHost: chessclub.com
   Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will connect to the ICS by
using `rsh' to run the command `telnet chessclub.com 5000' on host
`rsh.wall.com'.

   Suppose that you can telnet anywhere you want, but you have to run a
special program called `ptelnet' to do so.

   First, we'll consider the easy case, in which `ptelnet chessclub.com
5000' gets you to the chess server.  In this case set command line
options as follows:

     xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet

Or in your `.Xdefaults' file:

     XBoard*useTelnet: true
     XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet

Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will issue the command
`ptelnet chessclub.com 5000' to connect to the ICS.

   Next, suppose that `ptelnet chessclub.com 5000' doesn't work; that
is, your `ptelnet' program doesn't let you connect to alternative
ports. In this case, you will have to find some other host outside the
firewall that does let you do this, and hop through it. For instance,
suppose you have an account at `foo.edu'. Set command line options as
follows:

     xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet -icshost foo.edu -icsport ""

Or in your `.Xdefaults' file:

     XBoard*useTelnet: true
     XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
     XBoard*internetChessServerHost: foo.edu
     XBoard*internetChessServerPort:

Then when you run XBoard in ICS mode, it will issue the command
`ptelnet foo.edu' to connect to your account at `foo.edu'. Log in
there, then type `telnet chessclub.com 5000'.

   ICC timestamp and FICS timeseal do not work through many firewalls.
You can use them only if your firewall gives a clean TCP connection
with a full 8-bit wide path.  If your firewall allows you to get out
only by running a special telnet program, you can't use timestamp or
timeseal across it.  But if you have access to a computer just outside
your firewall, and you have much lower netlag when talking to that
computer than to the ICS, it might be worthwhile running timestamp
there.  Follow the instructions above for hopping through a host
outside the firewall (foo.edu in the example), but run timestamp or
timeseal on that host instead of telnet.

   Suppose that you have a SOCKS firewall that requires you to go
through some extra level of authentication, but after that will give
you a clean 8-bit wide TCP connection to the chess server.  In that
case, you could make a socksified version of XBoard and run that.  If
you are using timestamp or timeseal, you will to socksify it, not
XBoard; this may be difficult seeing that ICC and FICS do not provide
source code for these programs.  Socksification is beyond the scope of
this document, but see the SOCKS Web site at
http://www.socks.nec.com/how2socksify.html.

Environment variables
*********************

   Game and position files are found in a directory named by the
`CHESSDIR' environment variable. If this variable is not set, the
current working directory is used. If `CHESSDIR' is set, XBoard
actually changes its working directory to `$CHESSDIR', so GNU Chess
listing files will also be stored there as well.


File: xboard.info,  Node: Limitations,  Next: Problems,  Prev: Environment,  Up: Top

Known limitations and bugs
**************************

   There is no way for two people running copies of XBoard to play each
other without going through the `Internet Chess Server'.

   Under some circumstances, your ICS password may be echoed when you
log on.

   If you are connecting to the ICS by running telnet on an Internet
provider or firewall host, you may find that each line you type is
echoed back an extra time after you hit Return. If your Internet
provider is a Unix system, you can probably turn its echo off by typing

     stty -echo

after you log in, and/or typing <^E-Return> (<control-E> followed by
the <Return> key) to the telnet program after you have logged into ICS.
It is a good idea to do this if you can, because the extra echo can
occasionally confuse XBoard's parsing routines.

   The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

   The internal move legality tester does not look at the game history,
so in some cases it misses illegal castling or en passant captures.  It
permits castling with the king on the d file because this is possible in
some "wild 1" games on ICS.  It does not check piece drops in bughouse
to see if you actually hold the piece you are trying to drop.  However,
if you attempt an illegal move when using GNU Chess (or the ICS),
XBoard will accept the error message that comes back, undo the move,
and let you try another.

   FischeRandom castling is not supported.

   FEN positions saved by XBoard do not include correct information
about whether castling or en passant are legal.

   The mate detector does not understand that non-contact mate is not
really mate in bughouse.  The only problem this causes while playing is
minor: a `#' (mate indicator) character will show up after a
non-contact mating move in the move list.  XBoard will not assume the
game is over at that point.

   `Edit Game' mode always uses non-bughouse rules.  Although you can
load and edit games that contain piece drops, the piece menus are not
active, so you cannot insert piece drops.  Also, XBoard thinks an
edited game is over when a mating move is inserted, even if the mate is
non-contact.

   Some XBoard functions may not work with versions of GNU Chess earlier
than 4.0, patchlevel 77, or with versions of Crafty earlier than 15.11.
A few functions work with GNU Chess but not Crafty, or vice versa.

   The menus may not work if your keyboard is in Caps Lock or Num Lock
mode.  This seems to be a problem with the Athena menu widget.

   XBoard depends on the Xt Intrinsics and Athena Widget Set of X11R4
or later. In particular, X11R3 just won't do.

     tim.mann@compaq.com.

   Please use the `script' program to start a typescript, run XBoard
with the `-debug' option, and include the typescript output in your
message.  Also tell us what kind of machine and what operating system
version you are using.  The command `uname -a' will often tell you this.
Here is a sample of approximately what you should type:

     script
     uname -a
     ./configure
     make
     ./xboard -debug
     exit
     mail tim.mann@compaq.com
     Subject: problem with foobaz command in XBoard
     Description of the problem
     ~r typescript
     .

   If you improve XBoard, please send a message about your changes, and
we will get in touch with you about merging them in to the main line of
development.

Using XBoard for electronic correspondence chess
************************************************

   The `cmail' program will help you play chess by email with opponents
of your choice using XBoard as an interface.

   You will usually run `cmail' without giving any options.

* Menu:

* CMail options::  Invoking CMail.
* CMail game::     Starting a CMail game.
* CMail answer::   Answering a move.
* CMail trouble::  Known CMail problems.

Invoking CMail.
===============

-h
     Displays `cmail' usage information.

-c
     Shows the conditions of the GNU General Public License.  *Note
     Copying::.

-w
     Shows the warranty notice of the GNU General Public License.
     *Note Copying::.

-v
-xv
     Provides or inhibits verbose output from `cmail' and XBoard,
     useful for debugging. The `-xv' form also inhibits the cmail
     introduction message.

-mail
-xmail
     Invokes or inhibits the sending of a mail message containing the
     move.

-xboard
-xxboard
     Invokes or inhibits the running of XBoard on the game file.

-reuse

-xreuse
     Invokes or inhibits the reuse of an existing XBoard to display the
     current game.

-remail
     Resends the last mail message for that game. This inhibits running
     XBoard.

-game <name>
     The name of the game to be processed.

-wgames <number>
-bgames <number>
-games <number>
     Number of games to start as White, as Black or in total. Default
     is 1 as white and none as black. If only one color is specified
     then none of the other color is assumed. If no color is specified
     then equal numbers of White and Black games are started, with the
     extra game being as White if an odd number of total games is
     specified.

-me <short name>
-opp <short name>
     A one-word alias for yourself or your opponent.

-wname <full name>
-bname <full name>
-name <full name>
-oppname <full name>
     The full name of White, Black, yourself or your opponent.

-wna <net address>
-bna <net address>
-na <net address>
-oppna <net address>
     The email address of White, Black, yourself or your opponent.

-dir <directory>
     The directory in which `cmail' keeps its files. This defaults to
     the environment variable `$CMAIL_DIR' or failing that, `$CHESSDIR',
     `$HOME/Chess' or `~/Chess'. It will be created if it does not
     exist.

-arcdir <directory>
     The directory in which `cmail' archives completed games. Defaults
     to the environment variable `$CMAIL_ARCDIR' or, in its absence,
     the same directory as cmail keeps its working files (above).

-mailprog <mail program>
     The program used by cmail to send email messages. This defaults to
     the environment variable `$CMAIL_MAILPROG' or failing that
     `/usr/ucb/Mail', `/usr/ucb/mail' or `Mail'. You will need to set
     this variable if none of the above paths fit your system.

-gamesFile <file>
     A file containing a list of games with email addresses. This
     defaults to the environment variable `$CMAIL_GAMES' or failing that
     `.cmailgames'.

-aliasesFile <file>
     A file containing one or more aliases for a set of email
     addresses. This defaults to the environment variable
     `$CMAIL_ALIASES' or failing that `.cmailaliases'.

-logFile <file>
     A file in which to dump verbose debugging messages that are
     invoked with the `-v' option.

-event <event>
     The PGN Event tag (default `Email correspondence game').

-site <site>
     The PGN Site tag (default `NET').

-round <round>
     The PGN Round tag (default `-', not applicable).

-mode <mode>
     The PGN Mode tag (default `EM', Electronic Mail).

OTHER OPTIONS
     Any unrecognized flags will be passed to XBoard.  Those most
     relevant for use with Icmail\fP are `-timeDelay',
     `-noChessProgram', `-searchTime', `-searchDepth', `-saveGameFile',
     `-autosave', `-savePositionFile' and `-boardSize'. *Note
     Invocation::.

Starting a CMail game.
======================

   Type `cmail' from a shell to start a game as white. After an opening
message, you will be prompted for a game name, which is optional - if
you simply press return, the game name will take the form
`you-VS-opponent'. You will next be prompted for the short name of your
opponent. If you haven't played this person before, you will also be
prompted for his/her email address. `cmail' will then invoke XBoard in
the background. Make your first move and select `Mail Move' from the
`File' menu. *Note File Menu::. If all is well, `cmail' will mail a
copy of the move to your opponent. If you select `Exit' without having
selected `Mail Move' then no move will be made.


File: xboard.info,  Node: CMail answer,  Next: CMail trouble,  Prev: CMail game,  Up: CMail

Answering a move.
=================

   When you receive a message from an opponent containing a move in one
of your games, simply pipe the message through `cmail'. In some mailers
this is as simple as typing `| cmail' when viewing the message, while in
others you may have to save the message to a file and do `cmail < file'
at the command line. In either case `cmail' will display the game using
XBoard. If you didn't exit XBoard when you made your first move then
`cmail' will do its best to use the existing XBoard instead of starting
a new one. As before, simply make a move and select `Mail Move' from
the `File' menu. *Note File Menu::. `cmail' will try to use the XBoard
that was most recently used to display the current game. This means
that many games can be in progress simultaneously, each with its own
active XBoard.

   If you want to look at the history or explore a variation, go ahead,
but you must return to the current position before XBoard will allow you
to mail a move. If you edit the game's history you must select `Reload
Same Game' from the `File' menu to get back to the original position,
then make the move you want and select `Mail Move'.  As before, if you
decide you aren't ready to make a move just yet you can either select
`Exit' without sending a move or just leave XBoard running until you
are ready.

   Because XBoard can now detect checkmate and stalemate, `cmail' now
handles game termination sensibly. As well as resignation, the `Action'
menu now allows draws to be offered and accepted for `cmail' games.

   For multi-game messages, only unfinished and just-finished games
will be included in email messages. When all the games are finished,
they are archived in the user's archive directory, and similarly in the
opponent's when he or she pipes the final message through `cmail'. The
archive file name includes the date the game was started.

   It's possible to have a `cmail' message carry more than one game.
This feature was implemented to handle IECG (International Email Chess
Group) matches, where a match consists of 1 game as white and 1 as
black, with moves transmitted simultaneously. In case there are more
general uses, `cmail' itself places no limit on the number of
black/white games contained in a message; however, XBoard does.

Known CMail problems.
=====================

   It's possible that a strange conjunction of conditions may
occasionally mean that `cmail' has trouble reactivating an existing
XBoard. If this should happen, simply trying it again should work.  If
not, remove the file that stores the XBoard's PID (`game.pid') or use
the `-xreuse' option to force `cmail' to start a new XBoard.

   Versions of `cmail' after 2.16 no longer understand the old file
format that XBoard used to use and so cannot be used to correspond with
anyone using an older version.

   Versions of `cmail' older than 2.11 do not handle multi-game
messages, so multi-game correspondence is not possible with opponents
using an older version.

Other programs you can use with XBoard
**************************************

   Here are some other programs you can use with XBoard

* Menu:

* GNU Chess::        The GNU Chess engine
* Crafty::           The Crafty chess engine
* zic2xpm::          The program used to import chess sets from ZIICS


File: xboard.info,  Node: GNU Chess,  Next: Crafty,  Up: Programs

GNU Chess
=========

   The GNU Chess engine is available from:

   ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gnuchess/

   (The version number changes fairly often, so I left it out. Just get
whatever the latest version is.)

   You can use XBoard to play a game against GNU Chess, or to interface
GNU Chess to an ICS.


File: xboard.info,  Node: Crafty,  Next: zic2xpm,  Prev: GNU Chess,  Up: Programs

Crafty
======

   Crafty is a chess engine written by Bob Hyatt (hyatt@cis.uab.edu).
You can use XBoard to play a game against Crafty, hook Crafty up to an
ICS, or use Crafty to interactively analyze games and positions for you.

   Crafty is a strong, rapidly evolving chess program. This rapid pace
of development is good, because it means Crafty is always getting
better.  This can sometimes cause problems with backwards
compatibility, but usually the latest version of Crafty will work well
with the latest version of .BR xboard .  Crafty can be obtained from
its author's FTP site: ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/.

   To use Crafty with XBoard, give the -fcp and -fd options as follows,
where <crafty's directory> is the directory in which you installed
Crafty and placed its book and other support files.


File: xboard.info,  Node: zic2xpm,  Prev: Crafty,  Up: Programs

zic2xpm
=======

   The "zic2xpm" program is used to import chess sets from the ZIICS(*)
program into XBoard. "zic2xpm" is part of the XBoard distribution.
ZIICS is available from:

   ftp://ftp.freechess.org/pub/chess/DOS/ziics131.exe

   To import ZIICS pieces, do this:

1. Unzip ziics131.exe into a directory:
          unzip -L ziics131.exe -d ~/ziics

2. Use zic2xpm to convert a set of pieces to XBoard format.
     For example, let's say you want to use the FRITZ4 set. These files
     are named "fritz4.*" in the ZIICS distribution.

          mkdir ~/fritz4
          cd ~/fritz4
          zic2xpm ~/ziics/fritz4.*

3. Now, either give XBoard the "-xpm" option when starting up, e.g.:
          xboard -xpm ~/fritz4    (... other options ...)

     Or, add this line to your .Xdefaults file:

          xboard*xpmDirectory: ~/fritz4

   (*) ZIICS is a separate copyrighted work of Andy McFarland (Zek on
ICS).  The "ZIICS pieces" are copyrighted works of their respective
creators. Files produced by "zic2xpm" are for PERSONAL USE ONLY and may
NOT be redistributed without explicit permission from the original
creator(s) of the pieces.

GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
**************************

                         Version 2, June 1991
     Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111 USA
     
     Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
     of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble
========

   The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free
software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This
General Public License applies to most of the Free Software
Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors commit to
using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by
the GNU Library General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to
your programs, too.

   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for
this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it
if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in
new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.

   To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.
These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you
distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.

   For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that
you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the
source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their
rights.

   We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the software.

   Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we
want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so
that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original
authors' reputations.

   Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software
patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free
program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the
program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any
patent must be licensed for everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

   The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.

    TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a
     notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed
     under the terms of this General Public License.  The "Program",
     below, refers to any such program or work, and a "work based on
     the Program" means either the Program or any derivative work under
     copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Program or a
     portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
     translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
     included without limitation in the term "modification".)  Each
     licensee is addressed as "you".

     Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are
     not covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act
     of running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the
     Program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on
     the Program (independent of having been made by running the
     Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's
     source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you
     conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate
     copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
     notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
     warranty; and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of
     this License along with the Program.

     You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
     and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange
     for a fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion
     of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and
     distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
     above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

       a. You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

       b. You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that
          in whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program
          or any part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge
          to all third parties under the terms of this License.

       c. If the modified program normally reads commands interactively
          when run, you must cause it, when started running for such
          interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display
          an announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and
          a notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you
          provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute the
          program under these conditions, and telling the user how to
          view a copy of this License.  (Exception: if the Program
          itself is interactive but does not normally print such an
          announcement, your work based on the Program is not required
          to print an announcement.)

     These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
     identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the
     Program, and can be reasonably considered independent and separate
     works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not
     apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
     works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a
     whole which is a work based on the Program, the distribution of
     the whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions
     for other licensees extend to the entire whole, and thus to each
     and every part regardless of who wrote it.

     Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or
     contest your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the
     intent is to exercise the right to control the distribution of
     derivative or collective works based on the Program.

     In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the
     Program with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on
     a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not bring the
     other work under the scope of this License.

  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,
     under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms
     of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the
     following:

       a. Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable
          source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
          Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for
          software interchange; or,

       b. Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three
          years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your
          cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete
          machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be
          distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
          medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

       c. Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer
          to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is
          allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you
          received the program in object code or executable form with
          such an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)

     The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for
     making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete
     source code means all the source code for all modules it contains,
     plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts
     used to control compilation and installation of the executable.
     However, as a special exception, the source code distributed need
     not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
     source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
     kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable
     runs, unless that component itself accompanies the executable.

     If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering
     access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent
     access to copy the source code from the same place counts as
     distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not
     compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program
     except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt
     otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is
     void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this
     License.  However, parties who have received copies, or rights,
     from you under this License will not have their licenses
     terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
     signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify
     or distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions
     are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.
     Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or any work
     based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this
     License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
     distributing or modifying the Program or works based on it.

  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the
     Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
     original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program
     subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any
     further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights
     granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance
     by third parties to this License.

  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
     infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent
     issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order,
     agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this
     License, they do not excuse you from the conditions of this
     License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously
     your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
     obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the
     Program at all.  For example, if a patent license would not permit
     royalty-free redistribution of the Program by all those who
     receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only
     way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
     entirely from distribution of the Program.

     If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable
     under any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is
     intended to apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply
     in other circumstances.

     It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
     patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of
     any such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting
     the integrity of the free software distribution system, which is
     implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
     generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
     through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
     system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is
     willing to distribute software through any other system and a
     licensee cannot impose that choice.

     This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed
     to be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in
     certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces,
     the original copyright holder who places the Program under this
     License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
     excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only
     in or among countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this
     License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of
     this License.

  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
     versions of the General Public License from time to time.  Such
     new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version, but
     may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

     Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
     Program specifies a version number of this License which applies
     to it and "any later version", you have the option of following
     the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later
     version published by the Free Software Foundation.  If the Program
     does not specify a version number of this License, you may choose
     any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

 10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free
     programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the
     author to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted
     by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free Software
     Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our decision
     will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of
     all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
     and reuse of software generally.

                                NO WARRANTY

 11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
     WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
     LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
     HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT
     WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
     NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
     FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE
     QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE
     PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY
     SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

 12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
     WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY
     MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE
     LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL,
     INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
     INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
     DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU
     OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY
     OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN
     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs
=============================================

   If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it
free software which everyone can redistribute and change under these
terms.

   To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least
the "copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

     ONE LINE TO GIVE THE PROGRAM'S NAME AND AN IDEA OF WHAT IT DOES.
     Copyright (C) 19YY  NAME OF AUTHOR
     
     This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
     modify it under the terms of the GNU General Public License
     as published by the Free Software Foundation; either version 2
     of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
     
     This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
     but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
     MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the
     GNU General Public License for more details.
     
     You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License
     along with this program; if not, write to the Free Software
     Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111 USA.

   Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper
mail.

   If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like
this when it starts in an interactive mode:

     Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) 19YY NAME OF AUTHOR
     Gnomovision comes with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details
     type `show w'.  This is free software, and you are welcome
     to redistribute it under certain conditions; type `show c'
     for details.

   The hypothetical commands `show w' and `show c' should show the
appropriate parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the
commands you use may be called something other than `show w' and `show
c'; they could even be mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your
program.

   You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or
your school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program,
if necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

     Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright
     interest in the program `Gnomovision'
     (which makes passes at compilers) written
     by James Hacker.
     
     SIGNATURE OF TY COON, 1 April 1989
     Ty Coon, President of Vice

   This General Public License does not permit incorporating your
program into proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine
library, you may consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary
applications with the library.  If this is what you want to do, use the
GNU Library General Public License instead of this License.
