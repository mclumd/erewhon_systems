     The _c_m_a_i_l program will help you play  chess  by  email  with
     opponents  of  your choice using an X interface.  To use it,
     you will need to be able to run _x_b_o_a_r_d with which  _c_m_a_i_l  is
     distributed,  available by anonymous FTP from numerous sites
     around the world. It has been tested with _x_b_o_a_r_d _3._2; it may
     require modification for other versions.

     Type _c_m_a_i_l from a shell to start a game as white.  After  an
     opening message, you will be prompted for a game name, which
     is optional -- if you simply press  return,  the  game  name
     will  take  the  form  _y_o_u-VS-_o_p_p_o_n_e_n_t.   You  will  next be
     prompted for the  short  name  of  your  opponent.   If  you
     haven't played this person before, you will also be prompted
     for his/her email address.  _c_m_a_i_l will then invoke _x_b_o_a_r_d in
     the  background.   Make your first move and select _M_a_i_l _M_o_v_e
     from the _F_i_l_e menu.  If all is well, _c_m_a_i_l will mail a  copy
     of  the  move  to  your opponent. If you select _E_x_i_t without
     having selected _M_a_i_l _M_o_v_e then no move will be made.

     When you receive a message from  an  opponent  containing  a
     move  in  one of your games, simply pipe the message through
     _c_m_a_i_l.  In some mailers this  is  as  simple  as  typing  "|
     cmail"  when  viewing  the  message, while in others you may
     have to save the message to a file and do "cmail < file"  at
     the  command  line.   In  either case _c_m_a_i_l will display the
     game using _x_b_o_a_r_d. If you didn't exit _x_b_o_a_r_d when  you  made
     your  first  move  then  _c_m_a_i_l  will  do its best to use the
     existing _x_b_o_a_r_d instead of starting a new  one.  As  before,
     simply  make a move and select _M_a_i_l _M_o_v_e from the _F_i_l_e menu.
     _c_m_a_i_l will try to use the _x_b_o_a_r_d that was most recently used
     to  display the current game. This means that many games can
     be in progress simultaneously,  each  with  its  own  active
     _x_b_o_a_r_d.

     If you want to look at the history or explore  a  variation,
     go ahead, but you must return to the current position before
     _x_b_o_a_r_d will allow you to mail a move. If you edit the game's
     history  you must select _R_e_l_o_a_d _S_a_m_e _G_a_m_e from the _F_i_l_e menu
     to get back to the original position, then make the move you
     want  and  select  _M_a_i_l  _M_o_v_e.  As before, if you decide you
     aren't ready to make a move just yet you can  either  select
     _E_x_i_t  without  sending  a  move or just leave _x_b_o_a_r_d running
     until you are ready.

     Because _x_b_o_a_r_d can now detect checkmate and stalemate, _c_m_a_i_l
     now  handles  game termination sensibly. As well as resigna-
     tion, the _A_c_t_i_o_n menu now allows draws  to  be  offered  and
     accepted for _c_m_a_i_l games.

     For multi-game messages, only unfinished  and  just-finished
     games will be included in email messages. When all the games
     are finished, they are archived in the user's archive direc-

     the final message  through  _c_m_a_i_l.  The  archive  file  name

     It's possible to have a _c_m_a_i_l message carry  more  than  one
     game.  This feature was implemented to handle IECG (Interna-
     tional Email Chess Group) matches, where a match consists of
     1  game  as  white  and  1  as black, with moves transmitted
     simultaneously. In case there are more general  uses,  _c_m_a_i_l
     itself  places  no  limit on the number of black/white games
     contained in a message; however, _x_b_o_a_r_d does.

     It's possible that a strange conjunction of  conditions  may
     occasionally  mean  that  _c_m_a_i_l  has trouble reactivating an
     existing _x_b_o_a_r_d. If this should  happen,  simply  trying  it
     again  should  work. If not, remove the file that stores the
     _x_b_o_a_r_d's PID (<_g_a_m_e>.pid) or use the -_x_r_e_u_s_e option to force
     _c_m_a_i_l to start a new _x_b_o_a_r_d.

     Versions of _c_m_a_i_l after 2.16 no longer  understand  the  old
     file format that _x_b_o_a_r_d used to use and so cannot be used to
     correspond with anyone using an older version.

     Versions of _c_m_a_i_l older than 2.11 do not  handle  multi-game
     messages,  so multi-game correspondence is not possible with
     opponents using an older version.

     "._c_m_a_i_l_g_a_m_e_s" contains  a  list  of  games  with  the  email
     addresses of the opponents.

     "._c_m_a_i_l_a_l_i_a_s_e_s" contains one or more aliases for  a  set  of
     email addresses.

     to  Evan.Welsh@msdw.com  I'll  do  my  best to fix/implement
     them.
