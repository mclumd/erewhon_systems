This directory provides bitmaps with the same size and naming
conventions as those distributed till xboard-3.**
These bitmaps are distributed under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
coming with xboard.

The bitmaps contained herein were converted from my MetaFont
version of chess font. These are designed very well to deliver
good rastered images on low resolution devices. The general
shape of these fonts are designed after very old typefaces
used in printing chess books. They are not as fancy as the
currently used bitmaps of xboard, but I like them in their
'san serif'-ness - may be others too.
  The MetaFont source of this font may be obtained from me
under the GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE.
  To convert the pk-Files to bitmaps I used the conversion tool
mftobdf to generate X11-bdf - fonts, and then used a small C
program, to write the xbm-files.

[Elmar supplied only 80, 64, and 40 pixel bitmaps]

The 21-pixel bitmaps are also based on Elmar's font, but I hand-tuned
them quite a bit.  I converted them from the Metafont gf file by
running gftype and applying a C program of my own to the
human-readable output.

icon_white and icon_black were produced in the same way.

The 33, 45, 49, 54, and 58 pixel bitmaps are also based on Elmar's font.
They were converted using dopkbm.sh, followed by a manual pass with the
X bitmap editor to adjust the size (adding blank borders as needed) and
to hand-tune the pixels in a few cases where that was badly needed.
Here is some data that may be useful in later conversions:

In each case, fselch*.mf was formatted for 300 dpi.  On Linux with the
Red Hat tetex-0.4pl8-9 package, this required mag=0.5.  Example:

  mf
  \mode=localfont; mag=0.5; input fselch8.mf
  gftopk fselch8.300gf

On Red Hat with tetex-0.9-6, mag=1.0 was needed instead.

  mf
  \mode=localfont; mag=1.0; input fselch26.mf
  gftopk fselch26.300gf
