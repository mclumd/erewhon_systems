# SCCS:	@(#)README	70.1 01/26/94

The files in this directory are meant to be tutorials that demonstrate
different aspects of Quintus Prolog.

makefile.static:
	demonstrates how you might write a makefile to build
	a completely static executable (with no dependencies on shared
	libraries) linking in Prolog code and foreign code.

indexing.pl:
	demonstrates how indexing works in core Quintus Prolog.
	It also shows how you can use the QUI source debugger
	to spot places where your code leaves choicepoints.

There are three versions of an "ls" program in ls0.pl, ls1.pl and ls2.pl
which demonstrate different ways of using the Quintus Prolog foreign language
interface

ls0.pl:	The shortest solution just uses unix/1 to call the Unix ls command.
ls1.pl: Uses the structs package to setup structs from Prolog and calls
	the Unix library routines
ls2.pl: The structures are setup in C and more of the work is done in C.

ls.pl:  Provides support predicates for ls1.pl and ls2.pl
ls1.c:  An empty C file, just so that the Unix library functions called from
	ls1.pl can get linked properly.
ls2.c:  Support functions for ls2.pl

For more details see the comments in the source files.
