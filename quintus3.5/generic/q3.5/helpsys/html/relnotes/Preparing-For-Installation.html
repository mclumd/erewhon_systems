<h3 class="section">Preparing For Installation</h3>

   <p>The <var>QuintusDir</var> referred to throughout this
Installation Guide is the directory in which you will
be instaling your Quintus software.

   <p>You can choose any directory as <var>QuintusDir</var>, so long as there is
sufficient space.  Under UNIX, a popular location is
<code>/opt/quintus</code>.  Under Windows, a popular location is
<code>C:\Program Files\Quintus Prolog 3.5</code>.

   <p>If possible, we recommend that you do all installation tasks for Quintus
products while logged in as <code>root</code> on the file server where the
release will be installed.  This avoids many potential problems with
directory ownership and protection.

   <p>However, Quintus Prolog has been organized so that only the optional <code>sys</code>
component must be installed by <code>root</code>; all
other components can be installed by any user.

   <p>Your <var>QuintusDir</var> must be mounted (or mountable) by all machines
on which Quintus Prolog is to be used. 
At the beginning of the installation process you will be asked
to confirm your choice of <var>QuintusDir</var>.

   <p>Although we don't recommend it,
if you have an earlier version of Quintus Prolog Release 3 installed, you
can use the same directory for installing release 3.5, provided
that enough space is available.  You do not have to use that directory
and can use another one if you prefer.  You may wish to delete the
earlier version prior to unloading Quintus Prolog Release
3.5 in order to free disk space for your new release. 
Deleting an earlier version of Quintus Prolog Release 3 does not invalidate
saved states or other QOF files built with that release.  Older QOF
files will work with Release 3.5. 
However, saved states will no longer be executable from the UNIX shell
if you do this. In order to make a saved state executable from the UNIX shell,
it can be loaded into the 3.5 system and then saved out
again using the <code>save_program/1</code> predicate to create a new saved state
dependent on the new release.

   <p><strong>Warning:</strong>  Do not rename an old installation directory to make the name
available for the new release directory (unless you don't mind the old
release ceasing to work).  If you rename a Quintus release
directory you have to redo the installation process since the
directory name is inserted into a number of the executable files.
