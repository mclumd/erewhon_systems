<h4 class="subsection">Using Classes</h4>

   <p>Given this definition, the following command creates an instance of
the point class, assigning values to its <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots,
and prints a description of the point.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(point(3,4), PointObj),
          PointObj &lt;- print(user).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>The print message prints <code>(3.0,4.0)</code>. The variable
<code>PointObj</code> is bound to a Prolog term of the form

<pre class="example">     <code>point(</code><var>Address</var><code>)</code>
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>Address</var> is essentially a pointer to the object.

   <p>In general, an object belonging to a class <var>ClassName</var> will be
represented by a Prolog term of the form

<pre class="example">     <var>ClassName(Address)</var>
     </pre>

   <p>The name <var>ClassName</var> must be an atom. This manual refers to such a
term as if it were the object, not just a pointer to the object. 
Users are strongly discouraged from attempting to do pointer
arithmetic with the address.

   <p>After execution of this command, the point object still exists, but
the variable <code>PointObj</code> can no longer be used to access it. So,
while objects resemble clauses asserted into the Prolog database in
their persistence, there is no automatic way to search for an object. 
Objects are not automatically destroyed when they are no longer
needed. And, there is no automatic way to save an object from one
Prolog session to the next. It is the responsibility of the
programmer to keep track of objects, perhaps calling the
<code>destroy/1</code> predicate for particular objects that are no longer
needed or asserting bookkeeping facts into the Prolog database to keep
track of important objects.
