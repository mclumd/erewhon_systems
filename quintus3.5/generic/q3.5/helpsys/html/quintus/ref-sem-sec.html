<h4 class="subsection">Declarative and Procedural Semantics</h4>

   <p>The semantics of definite clauses should be fairly clear from the
informal  interpretations already given.  However, it is useful to have
a precise definition.  The <dfn>declarative semantics</dfn> of  definite  clauses
tells  us  which  goals  can  be  considered true according to a given
program, and is defined recursively as follows:

   <blockquote>

        <p>A goal is <dfn>true</dfn> if it is the head of some clause instance and
     each  of  the  goals  (if  any)  in  the body of that clause
     instance is true, where an <dfn>instance</dfn>
     of a clause (or term) is
     obtained  by  substituting,  for each of zero or more of its
     variables, a new term for all occurrences of the variable. 
</blockquote>

   <p>For example, if a program contains the procedure for <code>concatenate/3</code>,
declared in <a href="ref-sem-pro.html#ref-sem-pro">ref-sem-pro</a>, then the declarative semantics tells us that
(A) is true, because this goal is the head of a certain instance of
the second clause (K) for <code>concatenate/3</code>, namely (B), and we
know that the only goal in the body of this clause instance is true,
because it is an instance of the unit clause that is the first clause
for <code>concatenate/3</code>.
<pre class="example">     concatenate([a], [b], [a,b])
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     concatenate([a], [b], [a,b]):-
        concatenate([], [b], [b]).
     </pre>

   <p>Note that the declarative semantics makes  no  reference  to  the
sequencing of goals within the body of a clause, nor to the sequencing
of clauses within a program.  This sequencing information is, however,
very  relevant  for  the  <dfn>procedural semantics</dfn> that Prolog gives to
definite clauses.  The procedural semantics defines  exactly  how  the
Prolog  system  will execute a goal, and the sequencing information is
the means by which the Prolog programmer directs the system to execute
his  program  in a sensible way.  The effect of executing a goal is to
enumerate, one by one, its true instances.  Here is  an  informal
definition of the procedural semantics.

   <blockquote>

        <p>To <dfn>execute</dfn> a goal, the system searches forwards from the beginning of
the program for the first  clause whose   head   <dfn>matches</dfn>   or
<dfn>unifies</dfn>  with  the  goal.   The <dfn>unification</dfn> process (see "A
Machine-Oriented Logic Based on the Resolution Principle" by J.A. Robinson,
<em>Journal of the ACM</em> 12:23-44, January 1965) finds the most general common
instance  of  the  two  terms, which is unique if it exists.  If a match is
found, the matching  clause  instance is  then <dfn>activated</dfn> by executing
in turn, from left to right, each of the goals (if any) in its body.  If at
any time  the system  fails to find a match for a goal, it <dfn>backtracks</dfn>;
that is, it rejects the most recently activated clause, undoing  any
substitutions made by the match with the head of the clause.  Next it
reconsiders the original goal  that  activated  the rejected clause, and
tries to find a subsequent clause that also matches the goal. 
</blockquote>

   <p>For example, if we execute the goal expressed by the query (A) we find
that it matches the head of the second clause for <code>concatenate/3</code>, with
<code>X</code> instantiated to <code>[a|X1]</code>. The new variable <code>X1</code> is constrained by the
new goal produced, which is the recursive procedure call (B) and this
goal matches the second clause, instantiating <code>X1</code> to <code>[b|X2]</code>, and
yielding the new goal (C).
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>concatenate(X, Y, [a,b]).</kbd> (A)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     concatenate(X1, Y, [b]) (B)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     concatenate(X2, Y, []) (C)
     </pre>

   <p>Now this goal will only match the first clause, instantiating both <code>X2</code>
and <code>Y</code> to <code>[]</code>. Since there are no further goals to be executed, we have
a solution
<pre class="example">     X = [a,b]
     Y = []
     </pre>

   <p>That is, the following is a true instance of the original goal:
<pre class="example">     concatenate([a,b], [], [a,b])
     </pre>

   <p>If this solution is rejected, backtracking will generate  the  further
solutions
<pre class="example">     X = [a]
     Y = [b]
     
     X = []
     Y = [a,b]
     </pre>

   <p>in  that  order,  by  re-matching goals already solved once using the first
clause of <code>concatenate/3</code>, against the second clause.
