<h5 class="subsubsection">Loading Foreign Executables</h5>

   <p>The built-in Prolog predicate <code>load_foreign_executable/1</code> is used
to load foreign functions directly into Prolog from a shared object
file and to attach selected functions and routines in the loaded file
to Prolog predicates.

   <p>The example below demonstrates the use of these predicates to load code
compiled using the C compiler.

   <p>In the above example, <code>foreign</code> (or <code>foreign.pl</code>) is a file
containing facts that describe how Prolog is to call the foreign
functions. If it is given a filename without an extension then it
automatically appends the appropriate extension; thus in the example
above, <code>math</code> is specified to load <code>math.so</code>.

   <p>The loading process may fail if:
     <ul>

     <li>the facts in the database (see <a href="fli-p2f-lnk.html#fli-p2f-lnk">fli-p2f-lnk</a>) that describe how to link
foreign functions to Prolog procedures are incomplete;
<li>the foreign functions specified have already been loaded;
<li>the shared object file contains undefined symbols that could not
be resolved when loaded. 
</ul>

   <p>If the load does not complete successfully then an exception is raised and the
call to <code>load_foreign_executable/1</code> fails; no change is made to the
Prolog state. 
The load can be retried once the problem has been corrected.

   <p>Once a foreign program is loaded, it cannot be unloaded or replaced,
although you can abolish or redefine any procedure attached to it.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Notes:</strong>
          <ol type=1 start=1>

          <li> Any foreign file loaded via a
<code>load_foreign_executable/1</code>
command that is embedded in a file
being loaded into Prolog will be sought relative to the directory from which
the file is being loaded. 
For example, if the file <code>/usr/fred/test.pl</code> contains the command
          <pre class="example">               :- load_foreign_executable(test).
               </pre>

          <p>then the file to be loaded would be <code>/usr/fred/test.so</code>. 
</p><li> When the linker is given a library such as <code>-lX11</code>, it will
look for a "shared library" version and if one exists record this
library as a dependency in the shared object file. 
<code>load_foreign_executable/1</code> will then automatically load this library
(if not already loaded) when it loads the shared object file.

          <p>If the linker is given a library for which no shared library exists, then
object files from the static library are incorporated into the shared
object file as needed. 
  This means that any routine in a static
library that is to be accessed from Prolog must have some reference to
it in one of the object files being linked into the shared object
file. 
</p><li> It is better to load one large shared object file than many small ones. 
You may have several Prolog files that require routines from one
shared object file -- in other words, a shared library. 
The shared library is only loaded once, but different functions could be
attached to Prolog predicates in different calls to
<code>load_foreign_executable/1</code>. For example, under UNIX, most of the files in
the Prolog Library that load foreign code use the shared library file
<code>libpl.so</code>.
             </ol>

   <p>A description of the internal operation of the
<code>load_foreign_executable/1</code> predicate is given in <a href="fli-p2f-lfe.html#fli-p2f-lfe">fli-p2f-lfe</a>
to help solve more difficult foreign code loading problems.
