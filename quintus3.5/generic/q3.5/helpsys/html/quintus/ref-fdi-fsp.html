</ul>

   <p>As a convenience for the developer and as a means for extended portability
of the final application, Quintus Prolog provides a flexible mechanism
to localize the definitions of the system dependent parts of the file
and directory structure a program relies on, in such a way that the
application can be moved to a different directory hierarchy or to a completely
new file system, with a minimum of effort.

   <p>This mechanism, which can be seen as a generalization of the
<code>library_directory/1</code> scheme available in previous releases, presents
two main features:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>An easy way to create aliases for frequently used directories, thus
localizing the external, file system and directory structure dependent
directory name, to one single place in the program. 
<li>A possibility to associate more than one directory specification with each
alias, thus giving the developer full freedom in sub-dividing libraries,
and other collections of programs, as it best suits the structure of
the external file system, without making the process of accessing files
in the libraries any more complicated. In this case,
the alias can be said to represent a file search path, not only a
single directory.
        </ol>

   <p>The directory aliasing mechanism, together with the additional file search
capabilities of <code>absolute_file_name/3</code>, can effectively serve
as an intermediate layer between the external world and a portable program. 
For instance, the developer can hide
the directory representation by defining directory aliases, and he can
automatically get a proper file extension added, dependent on the type
of file he wants to access, by using the appropriate options to
<code>absolute_file_name/3</code>.

   <p>A number of directory aliases and file search paths, are predefined in
the Quintus Prolog system (though they can be redefined by the user). 
The most important of those is the <code>library</code> file search path,
giving the user instant access to the Quintus library, consisting of
several sub-directories and extensive supported programs and tools.

   <p>Specifying a library file, using the alias, is possible simply by replacing the
explicit file (and directory) specification with the following term:

<pre class="example">     library(<var>file</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>The name of the file search path, in this case <code>library</code>, is
the main functor
of the term, and indicates that <var>file</var> is to be found in one of the
library directories.

   <p>The association between the alias <code>library</code> (the name of the search path)
and the library directories (the definitions of the search path),
is defined by Prolog facts,
<code>library_directory/1</code>, which are searched in sequence to locate the
file. Each of these facts specifies a
directory where to search for <var>file</var>, whenever a file specification
of the form <code>library(</code><var>file</var><code>)</code> is encountered.

   <p>The library mechanism discussed above, which can be extended with
new directories associated with the alias <code>library</code>, has become
subsumed by the more general aliasing mechanism,
in which arbitrary names can be used as aliases for directories. The
general mechanism also gives the possibility of defining
path aliases in terms of already defined aliases.

   <p>In addition to <code>library</code>, the following aliases are predefined in
Quintus Prolog: <code>quintus</code>,  <code>runtime</code>, <code>system</code>, <code>helpsys</code>
<code>language</code> and <code>tutorial</code>. The interpretation of the predefined
aliases are explained below.
