<h4 class="subsection">Disjunction</h4>

   <p>As we have seen, the goals in the body of a sentence  are  linked
by  the  operator <code>,</code>, which can be interpreted as conjunction (<code>and</code>). 
It is sometimes convenient to use an additional operator <code>|</code>, standing
for  disjunction  (<code>or</code>).  (The  precedence  of  <code>|</code>  is  such that it
dominates <code>,</code> but is dominated by <code>:-</code>.)  An example is the clause (A), which can be read as (B).
<pre class="example">     grandfather(X, Z) :-
          (   mother(X, Y)
          |   father(X, Y)
          ),
          father(Y, Z). (A)
     </pre>

<pre class="display">     
     ``For any X, Y, and Z,
         X has Z as a grandfather if
         either the mother of X is Y
             or the father of X is Y,
         and the father of Y is Z.'' (B)
     </pre>

   <p>Such uses of disjunction can usually be eliminated by defining  an
extra predicate.  For instance, (A) is equivalent to (C)
<pre class="example">     grandfather(X, Z) :- parent(X, Y), father(Y, Z).
     parent(X, Y) :- mother(X, Y).
     parent(X, Y) :- father(X, Y). (C)
     </pre>

   <p>Therefore, disjunction will not be mentioned further in  the  following
more formal description of the semantics of clauses.

   <p>For historical reasons, the token <code>|</code>, when used outside a list, is
actually an alias for <code>;</code>.  The aliasing is performed when terms
are read in, so that (D) is read as if it were (E) thus you can use
<code>;</code> instead of <code>|</code> for disjunction if you like.

<pre class="example">     a :- b | c. (D)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     a :- b ; c. (E)
     </pre>

   <p>Note the double use of the <code>.</code> character.  Here it is used as
a sentence terminator, while in other instances it may be used in a string of
symbols that make up an atom (for example, the list functor <code>.</code>).  The
rule used to disambiguate terms is that a <code>.</code> followed by a
<dfn>layout-character</dfn> is regarded as the sentence
terminator <code>full-stop</code>, where a
layout-character is defined to be any character less than or equal to ASCII 32
(this includes space, tab, newline, and all control characters).
