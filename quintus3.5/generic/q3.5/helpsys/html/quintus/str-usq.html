<h3 class="section">Using Structs with QPC</h3>

   <p>The <code>structs</code> package is divided into two parts:
     <ul>

     <li>the part necessary to process foreign declarations
<li>the part that defines all the <code>structs</code> predicates (other than the
<code>foreign_type/2</code> declaration predicate). 
</ul>

   <p>The former file is not (usually) needed while your application is
running, while the latter part certainly is.  By separating <code>structs</code>
into two files, you may avoid including the <code>structs</code> declaration code
in your application.

   <p>In order to declare a foreign type or use foreign types in a
foreign function declaration, you must first load the file
<code>library(structs_decl)</code>.  Ordinarily, you would probably do this by
including an <code>ensure_loaded/1</code> or <code>use_module/[1,2,3]</code> call in your file. 
Unfortunately, this will not allow <code>qpc</code> to compile your file.  In order
both to use your file in the development system, and to compile it with
<code>qpc</code>, put the following line in your files that define foreign types or
use foreign types in foreign function declarations:
<pre class="example">         :- load_files(library(structs_decl),
                       [when(compile_time),if(changed)]).
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>when(compile_time)</code> tells <code>qpc</code> to load <code>library(structs_decl)</code> into <code>qpc</code>, and not
to record a dependency on it.  This means that <code>library(structs_decl)</code> will not be
part of your statically linked application.

   <p>If you accidentally use
<pre class="example">          :- ensure_loaded(library(structs_decl)).
     </pre>

   <p>it will compile in the development system, but when you <code>qpc</code> the file you will
get a warning.

   <p>Files that just <em>use</em> <code>structs</code> are much simpler.  Just add this to those files:
<pre class="example">         :- ensure_loaded(library(structs)).
     </pre>

   <p>There is another important complication.  If you have type declarations
in one file (call it A) that use types declared in another file (B), you
must declare (at least) a compile_time dependency.  So in file A, you'd
need to have the line:
<pre class="example">         :- load_files('B', [when(compile_time),if(changed)]).
     </pre>

   <p>This does not allow predicates in A to call predicates in B.  If you
need this, too, you should instead include in file A the line:
<pre class="example">         :- load_files('B', [when(both),if(changed)]).
     </pre>

   <p>You will also need to ensure that B is compiled to a QOF file before
trying to <code>qpc</code> A.  This requires that if A is a module-file, so must B be. 
If A is not a module-file, then B need not be a module-file (but it may
be).  If you use the <code>make</code> utility to maintain object files, you
might then want to add the following line to your <code>Makefile</code>:
<pre class="example">         A.qof:      B.qof
     </pre>
