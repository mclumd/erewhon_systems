<h5 class="subsubsection">Opening a Stream</h5>

   <p>Before I/O operations can take place on a stream, the stream must be
opened, and it must be set to be current input or current output.  As
illustrated in the figure "Categorization of Stream Handling Predicates", the operations
of opening and setting
are separate with respect to the stream predicates, and combined in the File
Specification Predicates.

     <ul>

     <li><code>open(</code><var>+File</var><code>, </code><var>+Mode</var><code>, </code><var>-Stream</var><code>)</code> attempts to open the file
<var>File</var> in the mode specified (read,write or append).  If the
<code>open/3</code> request is successful, a stream object, which can be
subsequently used for input or output to the given file, is unified
with <var>Stream</var>.

     <p>The <code>read</code> mode is used for input.  The <code>write</code> and
<code>append</code> modes are used for output.  The <code>write</code> option causes
a new file to be created for output.  If the file already exists, then
it is set to empty and its previous contents are lost.  The
<code>append</code> option opens an already-existing file and adds output to
the end of it.  The <code>append</code> option will create the file if it does
not already exist.

     <p>Options can be specified by calling <code>open/4</code>. 
</p><li><code>set_input(</code><var>Stream</var><code>)</code> makes <var>Stream</var> the current input stream. 
Subsequent input predicates
such as <code>read/1</code> and <code>get0/1</code> will henceforth use this stream.

     <li><code>set_output(</code><var>Stream</var><code>)</code> makes <var>Stream</var> the current output stream. 
Subsequent output
predicates such as <code>write/1</code> and <code>put/1</code> will henceforth use this
stream.

   </ul>

   <p>Opening a stream and making it current are combined in <code>see</code> and <code>tell</code>:

     <ul>

     <li><code>see(</code><var>S</var><code>)</code> makes file <var>S</var> the current input stream. 
If <var>S</var> is an atom, it is taken to be a file specification, and
          <ul>

          <li>if there is an open input stream associated with the filename, and that
stream was opened by <code>see/1</code>, then it is made the current input stream;

          <li>Otherwise, the specified
file is opened for input and made the current input stream.  If it is not
possible to open the file, <code>see/1</code> fails.  In addition, if the
<code>fileerrors</code> flag is set (as it is by default), <code>see/1</code> sends
an error message to the standard
error stream and calls <code>abort/0</code>, returning to the top level. 
</ul>

     <li><code>tell(</code><var>S</var><code>)</code> makes <var>S</var> the current output stream.
          <ul>

          <li>if there is an open output stream currently associated with the filename,
and that stream was opened by <code>tell/1</code>, then it is made the current output
stream;

          <li>Otherwise, the specified file
is opened for output and made the current output stream.  If the file
does not exist, it is created.  If it is not
possible to open the file (because of protections, for example), <code>tell/1</code> fails.  In addition, if the
<code>fileerrors</code> flag is set (which it is by default), <code>tell/1</code> sends
an error message to the standard
error stream and calls <code>abort/0</code>, returning to the top level. 
</ul>

   </ul>

   <p>It is important to remember to close streams when you have finished with
them. Use <code>seen/0</code> or <code>close/1</code> for input files, and
<code>told/0</code> or <code>close/1</code> for output files.

     <ul>

     <li><code>open_null_stream(</code><var>Stream</var><code>)</code> opens an output stream that is not
connected to any file and unifies its stream object with <var>Stream</var>. 
Characters or terms that are sent to this stream are thrown away. 
This predicate is useful because various pieces of local state are
kept for null streams: the predicates <code>character_count/2</code>,
<code>line_count/2</code>, and <code>line_position/2</code> can be used on these
streams (see <a href="ref-iou-sos.html#ref-iou-sos">ref-iou-sos</a>).
