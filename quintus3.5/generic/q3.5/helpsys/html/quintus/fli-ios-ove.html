<h4 class="subsection">Overview</h4>

   <p>The Quintus Prolog input/output system is designed to handle various
file formats, device-dependent I/O, and
in particular, it enables you to create customized Prolog streams in C. 
File-related input/output operations of a Prolog program can be
coded to be portable among different operating systems
and the underlying formats of files.

   <p>A <dfn>Prolog stream</dfn> is an
object storing the information about how to complete input/output
operations to a file, device or other form of I/O channel. 
All Prolog input/output operations
are performed through Prolog streams.

   <p>The embedding ("bottom") layer of the Quintus Prolog system provides a set of
default functions for handling normal Prolog streams. However,
<em>user defined streams</em> can be defined at runtime in such a way that Prolog
built-in I/O operations work on other types of Prolog stream. 
Examples of user-defined streams include:

     <ul>

     <li>a stream to inter-process communication
<li>a stream to a window in a graphic environment
</ul>

   <p>There are three streams opened by the embedding layer I/O initialization
functions when a Prolog process starts:

     <ul>

     <li>user input stream: normal input channel
<li>user output stream: normal output channel
<li>user error stream: normal error message channel
</ul>

   <p>Prolog also keeps track of two current streams,
     <ul>

     <li>current input stream
<li>current output stream
</ul>

   <p>A Prolog input/output built-in predicate or function that takes no
stream argument is performed on the current input or current output
stream.

   <p>In this section, we outline the Quintus Prolog input/output model and describe
the Prolog stream structure, defining the different formats and options that
can be associated with a stream. Then we discuss the method of creating
a user-defined stream.

   <p>We also list a number of functions that enable Prolog streams to be
manipulated in foreign code. Finally we discuss some compatability issues
with the I/O system in previous versions of Quintus Prolog.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> The terms <dfn>record</dfn> and <dfn>line</dfn> have
the same meaning in this section.  A line terminated with
&lt;LFD&gt; is just a type of record. 
However, a record (line) is not always terminated by &lt;LFD&gt;.
