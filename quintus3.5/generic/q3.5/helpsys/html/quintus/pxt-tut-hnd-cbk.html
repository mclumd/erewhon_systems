<h5 class="subsubsection">Widget Callbacks</h5>

   <p>One type of events corresponds to changes in the widget state. They
are known as widget callbacks and each widget has its own set of them. 
There is a logical connection between the type of the widgets and
their callbacks.  For example, the push button widget has a callback,
which is activated when it is pressed.

   <p>There are few alternative ways of registering callback procedures. 
First, the callbacks are widget resources whose values are the
corresponding procedures, therefore they can be set as such at
creation. In addition, the X Toolkit provides a way for callbacks to
be set explicitly.  This can be done with the predicates
<code>xtAddCallback/4</code> and <code>xtAddCallbacks/3</code>.

   <p>In <code>xtAddCallback/4</code> the first argument is the widget for which the
callback is registered, the second is the callback name. The third
argument is the name of the procedure to be called and the last
argument is some data that the programmer wants to pass to the
callback procedure. In <code>xtAddCallbacks/3</code> the last argument is a
list of terms of type <code>callback(</code><var>Predicate</var><code>,</code><var>ClientData</var><code>)</code> where
<var>Predicate</var> is the name of the procedure to be called and
<var>ClientData</var> is the data that the programmer wants to pass to the
callback procedure. If the callback is set as a widget resource then
the resource value is of the same term as used in the
<code>xtAddCallbacks/3</code> list. For example,
<pre class="example">        xmCreatePushButton(Shell,push_button,
          [xmNactivateCallback(callback(pressed,'Hello Quintus!'))])
     </pre>

   <p>would add a callback to the push button at creation time.

   <p>The callback procedures must be of arity 3. The first argument is the
widget for which the callback was registered.  The second argument is
reserved for data that the programmer may want pass to the procedure
and the last argument is used by the Motif widgets to pass widget
specific data to the application.

   <p>Following is an extension of the first example showing how to register
a widget callback using <code>xtAddCallbacks/3</code>:

<pre class="example">     create_button :-
             xtAppInitialize(App,'Demo',[],Shell),
             xmCreatePushButton(Shell,push_button,
                                [xmNwidth(100), xmNheight(100)],Button),
             xtManageChild(Button),
             xtAddCallback(Button,xmNactivateCallback,pressed,
                           'Hello Quintus!'),
             xtRealizeWidget(Shell),
             xtAppMainLoop(App).
     
     pressed(Widget, ClientData, CallData) :-
             write(Widget), nl,
             write(ClientData), nl,
             write(CallData), nl.
     </pre>

   <p>To remove callbacks use <code>xtRemoveCallback</code>, <code>xtRemoveCallbacks</code>,
or <code>xtRemoveAllCallbacks</code>.
