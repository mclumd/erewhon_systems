<h5 class="subsubsection">Abstract and Mixin Classes</h5>

   <p>While Quintus Objects only supports a limited form of multiple
inheritance, its facilities are sufficient for working with so-called
<dfn>mixin classes</dfn>.

   <p>The idea is to construct similar classes by first defining a class
that contains the things the desired classes have in
common. Typically, this will be an <dfn>abstract class</dfn>, which will have no
instances itself. Then, provide the features that differentiate the
desired classes with a set of mixin classes

   <p>Mixin classes that have nothing in common can safely be mixed
together, to build the desired classes. The mixin classes will usually
be abstract classes, also, because they are too specialized for their
instances to be useful on their own.

   <p>The date_stamp class defined earlier would make a good mixin class. A
similar <code>time_stamp</code> class might be (partially) defined as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class time_stamp =
             [hour:integer,
              minute:integer,
              second:integer].
     
     Self &lt;- create :-
             time(time(Hour, Minute, Second)),
             store_slot(hour, Hour),
             store_slot(minute, Minute),
             store_slot(second, Second).
     </pre>

   <p>Another mixin class might be used to "register" objects in the Prolog
database.

<pre class="example">     :- class registry = [name:atom].
     
     Self &lt;- create(Name) :-
             Self &lt;&lt; name(Name),
             assert(registered(Name, Self)).
     
     Self &lt;- destroy :-
             Self &gt;&gt; name(Name),
             retract(registered(Name, Self)).
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>registry</code> mixin class could have been used with the <code>point</code>
class to define the <code>named_point</code> class, which was an example from
an earlier section.

   <p>The ability to send a message to an object's superclass is useful when
working with mixin classes. Suppose the definition of a new class
begins with

<pre class="example">     :- <var>NewClass</var> = <var>OldClass</var> + date + time + registry.
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>OldClass</var> is some previously defined class that lacks the
features provided by the <code>date</code>, <code>time</code> and <code>registry</code>
classes. (In fact, they should not have any slot names in common.) 
Then its create method can be defined by

<pre class="example">     Self &lt;- create(Name) :-
             super(OldClass) &lt;- create,
             super(date) &lt;- create,
             super(time) &lt;- create,
             super(registry) &lt;- create(Name).
     </pre>

   <p>This avoids the need to duplicate the code in the create methods of
OldClass and all three mixin classes.
