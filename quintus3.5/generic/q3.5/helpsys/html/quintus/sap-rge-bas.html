<h4 class="subsection">Introduction</h4>

   <p>The purpose of the Runtime Generator is to provide a convenient and
cost-effective way to distribute Prolog application programs to
end-users.  Initially a Prolog application should be developed using
the Development System.  The Development System allows the application
developer to load, run, modify and debug programs interactively,
without having to leave the environment.  When an application program
has been completed, the Runtime Generator product allows a developer
to create a production version of the application, ready to be shipped
to end-users.  This version of the application is called a
<dfn>runtime system</dfn>.

   <p>The important points to note about runtime systems are:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>They can easily be deployed, because they do not require any
authorization codes in order to run. 
<li>They are smaller than programs built on top of the Development System, since
they do not include program development features such as the compiler, the
debugger and the Emacs interface
        </ol>

   <p>The process of building a runtime system is almost identical to the
process of building a <dfn>stand-alone program</dfn> with the Development
System, and both of these processes are documented in
<a href="sap-srs.html#sap-srs">sap-srs</a>.  The compiler <code>qpc</code> is used to compile
your Prolog source files into Quintus Object Format (QOF) files, and
these are then linked together using the link editor <code>qld</code>. 
Both <code>qpc</code> and <code>qld</code> require a <code>-D</code>
command-line option when building a stand-alone program; the
default is to build a runtime system.

   <p>It is recommended that before turning an application program into a runtime
system you first build it as a stand-alone program.  This way, if there are any
problems, you will have the debugger available to help you eliminate them.

   <p>Once you have built a stand-alone program, it should be very easy to rebuild
the application as a runtime system.  This section describes the few
points that may need to be considered in making this transition:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Some built-in predicates are not available in runtime systems, since they
are intended for use in program development rather than for use in application
programs.  See <a href="sap-rge-dspn.html#sap-rge-dspn">sap-rge-dspn</a>. 
<li>Runtime systems do not have the normal Prolog top level.  Instead, you
must specify a starting point for the program by defining the
predicate <code>runtime_entry/1</code>.  This predicate also allows you to
specify what is to be done after an abort occurs.  See
<a href="sap-rge-pro.html#sap-rge-pro">sap-rge-pro</a>. 
<li>Runtime systems have different default behavior on a <kbd>^C</kbd>
interrupt.  Instead of giving the user a set of choices, the system
immediately aborts. See <a href="sap-rge-iha.html#sap-rge-iha">sap-rge-iha</a>. 
<li>   If your runtime system contains dependencies on "non-standard" shared
   libraries, or on one or more shared object files (specified in calls to
   <code>load_foreign_executable/1</code>), then in order to be able to deliver the
   runtime system to a different machine you will need either

          <ol type=a start=1>

          <li>   to make the system completely self-contained
   by replacing the shared object files and libraries with equivalent archive
   files when building it; or
<li>   to ensure that all necessary shared libraries and shared object files
   are available on the target machine.

          </ol>

     <p>See <a href="sap-rge-sos.html#sap-rge-sos">sap-rge-sos</a> for more information on this issue.
        </ol>

   <p>Another difference between runtime systems and programs running under the
Development System is that runtime systems suppress informative error messages,
on the basis that such messages are intended for the application developer, not
the application user.  For example, if a runtime system consults a file, no
message is printed to the screen to indicate this.  If you wanted some such
message to appear at runtime, you would have to program it yourself.

   <p>Error messages are not suppressed, however.  If you want to suppress
the printing of some (or all) error messages you can do it by
providing a definition for the predicate <code>message_hook/3</code>.  See
<a href="ref-msg-umf-ipm.html#ref-msg-umf-ipm">ref-msg-umf-ipm</a>.
