<h4 class="subsection">Drawing text</h4>

   <p>Drawing text in ProXL is like drawing lines or shapes.  This means that
every command to draw text must supply a position at which the text is
to be drawn.  ProXL does not maintain a <dfn>current</dfn> drawing
position in a window, so you cannot use the standard Prolog
primitives such as <code>write/[1,2]</code>, or <code>format/[2,3]</code><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1"><sup>1</sup></a> for putting text into an X window.

   <p>Furthermore, note that the position in a drawable at which text is to be
drawn is given in pixel coordinates, not character coordinates.  There
are three reasons for this:

     <ul>

     <li>Using pixel coordinates gives you much greater flexibility in
positioning and spacing of text. 
<li>The font in which you are printing may not be fixed width (see
<a href="pxl-bas-graf-font.html#pxl-bas-graf-font">pxl-bas-graf-font</a>), so you cannot reliably determine where to print by
multiplying the width of a character by the number of characters. 
<li>X provides for fonts that write from right to left, so it is not
always sufficient to add the pixel width of a string to its origin
position to determine its right side.  In this case, the origin point
is at the right end of the string. 
</ul>

   <p>ProXL provides primitives for determining how large a string will be
when it is displayed, including a primitive that will determine how
many pixels left, right, above, and below the origin point a text
string will occupy.

<ol type="1">
<li><a name="fn-1"></a>
<p>Of course, the
Prolog text output primitives will continue to work in the window you
are running Prolog in.  This is usually a terminal emulator window
maintained by a program such as xterm; X does not automatically do
this.</p>
