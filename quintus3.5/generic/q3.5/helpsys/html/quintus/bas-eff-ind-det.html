<h5 class="subsubsection">Determinacy Detection</h5>

   <p>The other advantage of indexing is that it often makes possible early
detection of determinacy, even if cuts are not included in the program. 
For example, consider the following simple predicate, which joins two
lists together:
<pre class="example">     concat([], L, L).
     concat([X|L1], L2, [X|L3]) :- concat(L1, L2, L3).
     </pre>

   <p>If this predicate is called with an instantiated first argument, the
first argument indexing of Quintus Prolog
will recognize that the call is determinate -- only one of
the two clauses for <code>concat/3</code> can possibly apply. 
Thus, the Prolog system knows it does not have
to store backtracking information for the call.  This significantly reduces
memory use and execution time.

   <p>Determinacy detection can also reduce the number of cuts in
predicates.  In the above example, if there was no indexing, a cut would not
strictly be needed in the first clause as long as the predicate was always to
be called with the first argument instantiated.  If the first clause matched,
then the second clause could not possibly match; discovery of this fact,
however, would be postponed until backtracking.  The programmer might
thus be tempted to use a cut in the first clause to signal determinacy
and recover space for backtracking information as early as possible.

   <p>With indexing, if the example predicate is always called with its first
argument instantiated, backtracking information is <em>never</em> stored. 
This gives substantial performance improvements over using a cut
rather than indexing to force determinacy. 
At the same time greater flexibility is maintained:
the predicate can now be used in a nondeterminate fashion as well, as in
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>concat(L1, L2, [a,b,c,d]).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>which will generate on backtracking all the possible partitions of the
list [a,b,c,d] on backtracking.  If a cut had been used in the first clause,
this would not work.
