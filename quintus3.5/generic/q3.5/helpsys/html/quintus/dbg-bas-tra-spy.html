<h5 class="subsubsection">Spypoints</h5>

   <p><dfn>Spypoints</dfn> allow you to indicate where to stop on
a per-predicate or even per-goal basis.  For example, you might find
that you want to run until some particular predicate is called.  In
this case, you would set a spypoint on that predicate, using
<code>spy/1</code>.  Such spypoints are turned off with <code>nospy/1</code>.

   <p>It may be desirable to stop when you get to a particular call from one
predicate to another.  This can be done with the built-in predicate
<code>add_spypoint/1</code>.  These spypoints can be removed with
<code>remove_spypoint/1</code>.

   <p>To examine spypoints, use <code>current_spypoint/1</code>.  Spypoints are
also included in the output of <code>debugging/0</code>.  Finally, spypoints
can be removed all at once with <code>nospyall/0</code>.

   <p>The debuggers also have commands for setting spypoints, which are
easier to use than these predicates.
