<h4 class="subsection">The Procedure Box Control Flow Model</h4>

   <p>During debugging, the debugger stops at various points in the execution
of a goal, allowing you see what arguments the goal is called with, what
arguments it returns with, and whether it succeeds or fails.  As in
other programming languages, key points of interest are procedure entry
and return, but in Prolog there is the additional complexity of
backtracking.  One of the major confusions that novice Prolog
programmers have to face is the question of what actually happens when a
goal fails and the system suddenly begins backtracking.  The procedure
box model of Prolog execution views program control flow in terms of
movement from clause to clause in the procedures of the program.  This
model provides a basis for the debugging mechanism
and enables the user to view program behavior in a consistent way.

   <p>Let us look at a representative Prolog procedure:

<pre class="example">              +----------------------------------------+
        Call  |                                        |  Exit
     --------&gt;|  descendant(X, Y) :- offspring(X, Y).  |-------&gt;
              |                                        |
              |  descendant(X, Z) :-                   |
     &lt;--------|     offspring(X, Y), descendant(Y, Z). |&lt;-------
        Fail  |                                        |  Redo
              +----------------------------------------+
     </pre>

   <p>The first clause states that <var>Y</var> is a descendant of <var>X</var> if <var>Y</var> is
an offspring of <var>X</var>, and the second clause states that <var>Z</var> is
a descendant of <var>X</var> if <var>Y</var> is an offspring of <var>X</var> and if <var>Z</var> is a
descendant of <var>Y</var>. 
In the diagram a box has been drawn around the whole procedure;
labeled arrows indicate the control flow
into and out of this box. 
There are four such arrows, which we shall describe in turn.

     <dl>

     <br><dt>Call
     <dd>This arrow represents an initial invocation of the procedure.  When a
goal of the form <code>descendant(X,Y)</code> must be satisfied, control passes
through the Call port of the <code>descendant/2</code> box with the intention of
matching the head of a component clause and then satisfying any
subgoals in the body of that clause.  Notice that this is independent
of whether such a match is possible; first the box is called, and then
the attempt to match takes place.  Textually we can imagine moving to
the code for <code>descendant/2</code> when meeting a call to <code>descendant/2</code> in some
other part of the code.

     <br><dt>Exit
     <dd>This arrow represents a
successful return from the procedure.  This occurs when the initial goal
has been unified with the head of one of the component clauses and all
subgoals have been satisfied.  Control now passes out of the Exit port
of the <code>descendant/2</code> box.  Textually we stop following the code for
<code>descendant/2</code> and go back to the code we came from.

     <br><dt>Redo
     <dd>This arrow indicates that a
subsequent goal has failed and that the system is backtracking in an
attempt to find alternatives to previous solutions.  Control passes into
the <code>descendant/2</code> box through the Redo port.  An attempt will now be made
to resatisfy one of the component subgoals in the body of the clause
that last succeeded; or, if that fails, to completely rematch the
original goal with an alternative clause and then try to satisfy any
subgoals in the body of this new clause.  Textually we follow the code
backwards up the way we came looking for new ways of succeeding,
possibly dropping down onto another clause and following that if
necessary.

     <br><dt>Fail
     <dd>This arrow represents a failure
of the initial goal, which might occur if no clause is matched, or if
subgoals are never satisfied, or if all solutions produced are always
rejected by later processing.  Control now passes out of the Fail port
of the <code>descendant/2</code> box and the system continues to backtrack. 
Textually we move back to the code that called this procedure and keep
moving backwards up the code looking for new ways of succeeding.

   </dl>

   <p>Note that the box we have drawn around the procedure should really be seen
as an <dfn>invocation</dfn> box, rather than a procedure box.  Often, there are
many different Calls and Exits to a particular procedure in the control
flow, but these are for different invocations. 
Each invocation box is given a unique integer identifier to prevent
confusion.
