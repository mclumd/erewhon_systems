<h4 class="subsection">Drawing Pixmaps and drawing into Pixmaps</h4>

   <p>Apart from drawing shapes or text into a window, we often wish to
import complex pictures from an inventory.  In ProXL these are stored
in <dfn>pixmaps</dfn>.

   <p>A <dfn>pixmap</dfn> is a rectangular area that can be drawn into, but cannot
be seen.  It may be copied into a window to be seen.  It is common to
draw frequently used complicated drawings into a pixmap, and then to
copy the pixmap to a window whenever it is needed.  Pixmaps are also
used for representing textures, in which case they are <dfn>tiled</dfn>, that
is, copied repeatedly like floor tiles, when they are displayed.

   <p>Pixmaps, like windows, are <dfn>drawables</dfn>, that is, something that
you can draw into, not, as you might expect, something that is drawn. 
Most drawing primitives take a drawable as their destination
argument as they can draw into either windows or pixmaps.
