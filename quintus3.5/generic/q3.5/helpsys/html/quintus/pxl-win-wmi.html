   <p>In the X Window System, window managers largely control how an
application's windows behave.  Applications inform the currently
active window manager of important facts and hints about a window by
storing properties of certain names and types on that window.  Each
window manager determines what it will do with this information by
itself; your application does <em>not</em> have any control over it.

   <p>X does establish many conventions for what window managers are expected
to do, and you are encouraged to use those conventions.  However,
at this stage in the development of the X Window System, most window
managers do not follow all these conventions.  Keep this in mind when
you are testing code that makes demands of window managers:  your test
may be failing due to no fault in your program, but simply because the
window manager you are using does not support the feature you require.

   <p>All interaction with the window manager is done through window
properties.  As described above (see <a href="pxl-win-atts.html#pxl-win-atts">pxl-win-atts</a>), window properties
are window attributes of the form
<pre class="example">     property(Name,Value)
     </pre>

   <p>These can be set with <code>create_window</code> and <code>put_window_attributes</code>.
