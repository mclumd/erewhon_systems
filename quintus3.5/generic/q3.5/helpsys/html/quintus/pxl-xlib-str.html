<h4 class="subsection">Data Structures</h4>

   <p>Xlib has three basic kinds of data structures:  documented C structures,
undocumented C structures, and XIDs.  The documented C structures are
used as any C structure would be; the undocumented C structures are
accessed through standard macros and functions; and the XIDs are used
only as arguments to Xlib functions.

   <p>ProXL doesn't have these types, instead it has only <dfn>foreign terms</dfn> and
regular Prolog terms.  Foreign terms are Prolog terms that represent X
objects.  These objects are analogous to undocumented C structures in
that their contents are not directly accessible, but it is not necessary
to send a message to the server to get the contents.

   <p>Foreign terms, at the moment, are simply unary Prolog terms whose
functor indicates the type of the foreign term and whose argument
specifies the location of the contents of the data structure.  Note that
this implementation may be changed at any time, so you should not count
on it.

   <p>One useful property of the current implementation is that the printed
representation of a foreign term may be read back in, and will yield
the same data structure.  This is useful when debugging and when
prototyping, since it means you can grab results of a goal you just
ran and feed them in as arguments to the next goal you want to run.

   <p>All foreign terms representing XIDs contain not only the XID of the X
resource, but also the display, and, where appropriate, the screen, on
which this XID lives.  This means that where Xlib requires both a
display and an XID, ProXL only needs the foreign term.  Therefore, very
few ProXL procedures take a display as argument.
