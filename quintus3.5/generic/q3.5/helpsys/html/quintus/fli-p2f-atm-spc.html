<h5 class="subsubsection">Passing Atoms as Strings between Prolog and C</h5>

   <p>This section describes passing atoms as pointers to null-terminated
character strings.  This is the way to pass atoms as strings between
Prolog and C.  For FORTRAN and Pascal, the specification of string
arguments is different than for C; see <a href="fli-p2f-atm-spf.html#fli-p2f-atm-spf">fli-p2f-atm-spf</a>.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +string
     C:       char *x
     Pascal:  Not supported
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>The argument must be instantiated to an atom, otherwise
   the call will signal an error. 
   A pointer to a null-terminated string of characters
   is passed to the C function.  This
   string must not be overwritten by the C function.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -string
     C:       char **x;
              *x = ...
     Pascal:  Not supported
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a character pointer is passed to the C function.  It is
   assumed that C will overwrite this character pointer with the result it
   wishes to return.  This result should be a pointer to a null-terminated
   string of characters.  When the C function returns, the atom that has
   the printed representation specified by the string is unified with the
   corresponding argument of the Prolog call.  The argument can be of any
   type; if it cannot be unified with the returned atom, then the call fails. 
   If the C function does not overwrite the character pointer, then
   the result is undefined.

   <p>Prolog copies the string if required, so
   that it is not necessary for the C program to worry about retaining it. 
   Beware, however, that the string must not be an <code>auto</code>, because in this
   case its storage may be reclaimed after the foreign function exits but
   before Prolog has managed to copy it.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  [-string]
     C        char *f(...)
                {
                  char *x;
                  return x;
                }
     Pascal:  Not supported
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>No argument is passed to C. The return value from the C function is
   assumed to be a character pointer pointing to a null-terminated string
   of characters.  The atom that has the printed representation specified
   by the string is unified with the corresponding argument of the Prolog
   call.  The argument can be of any type; if it cannot be unified with the
   returned atom, the call fails.

   <p>Prolog copies the string if required, so
   that it is not necessary for the C program to worry about retaining it. 
   Beware, however, that the string must not be an <code>auto</code>, because in this
   case its storage may be reclaimed after the foreign function exits but
   before Prolog has managed to copy it.
