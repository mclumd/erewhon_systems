<h5 class="subsubsection">Overview</h5>

   <p>Operators in Prolog are simply a notational convenience. 
For example, <code>+</code> is an infix operator, so
<pre class="example">     2 + 1
     </pre>

   <p>is an alternative way of writing the term <code>+(2, 1)</code>. 
That is, <code>2 + 1</code> represents the data structure
<pre class="example">                +
              /   \
             2     1
     </pre>

   <p>and <em>not</em> the number 3. 
(The addition would only be performed if the structure were passed as an
argument to an appropriate procedure, such as <code>is/2</code>; see <a href="ref-ari-eae.html#ref-ari-eae">ref-ari-eae</a>.)

   <p>Prolog syntax allows operators of three kinds: <dfn>infix</dfn>,
<dfn>prefix</dfn>, and <dfn>postfix</dfn>.  An infix operator appears between
its two arguments, while a prefix operator precedes its single
argument and a postfix operator follows its single argument.

   <p>Each operator has a <dfn>precedence</dfn>, which is a
number from  1  to  1200.  The  precedence  is  used  to  disambiguate
expressions  in which  the  structure  of  the  term  denoted is not made
explicit through the  use  of  parentheses.   The  general  rule
is that the operator with the
<em>highest</em> precedence is the principal functor.  Thus if <code>+</code>  has  a
higher precedence than <code>/</code>, then
<pre class="example">     a+b/c     a+(b/c)
     </pre>

   <p>are equivalent, and denote the term <code>+(a,/(b,c))</code>. Note that the  infix
form of the term <code>/(+(a,b),c)</code> must be written with explicit parentheses:
<pre class="example">     (a+b)/c
     </pre>

   <p>If there are two operators in the expression having  the  same highest
precedence,  the ambiguity must be resolved from the <dfn>types</dfn> of the
operators.  The possible types for an infix operator are
     <ul>

     <li><code>xfx</code>
<li><code>xfy</code>
<li><code>yfx</code>
</ul>

   <p>Operators of type <code>xfx</code> are not associative:  it is required that
both of the arguments of the operator be subexpressions of
<em>lower</em> precedence than the operator itself; that is, the principal
functor of each subexpression must be of lower precedence, unless the
subexpression is
written in parentheses (which gives it zero precedence).

   <p>Operators of type <code>xfy</code> are right-associative:
only the first (left-hand) subexpression must
be of lower precedence;  the right-hand subexpression
can be of the <em>same</em>  precedence  as the main operator. 
Left-associative operators (type <code>yfx</code>) are the other way around.

   <p>An atom named <var>Name</var> is  declared  as  an
operator of type <var>Type</var> and precedence <var>Precedence</var> by the command
<pre class="example">     :-op(<var>Precedence, Type, Name</var>).
     </pre>

   <p>An operator declaration can be cancelled by redeclaring the <var>Name</var>
with the same <var>Type</var>, but <var>Precedence</var> 0.

   <p>The argument <var>Name</var> can also be a list of names of operators of the same
type and precedence.

   <p>It is possible to have more than one operator of the  same  name,
so long as they are of different kinds:  infix, prefix, or postfix. 
An operator of any kind may be redefined by a new declaration  of  the
same  kind. 
Declarations for all these <dfn>built-in operators</dfn> can be found in
<a href="ref-syn-ops-bop.html#ref-syn-ops-bop">ref-syn-ops-bop</a>.

   <p>For example, the built-in operators <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> are as if they
had been declared by (A) so that (B) is valid syntax, and means (C) or pictorially (D).
<pre class="example">     :-op(500, yfx, [+,-]). (A)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     a-b+c (B)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     (a-b)+c (C)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">                  +
                /   \
               -     c
              / \
             a   b (D)
     </pre>

   <p>The list functor <code>./2</code> is not a standard operator, but we could declare it
to be (E) then (F) would represent the structure (G).
<pre class="example">     :-op(600, xfy, .). (E)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">     a.b.c (F)
     </pre>

<pre class="example">                .
               / \
              a   .
                 / \
                b   c (G)
     </pre>

   <p>Contrasting this with the diagram above for a-b+c shows the difference
between <code>yfx</code> operators where the tree grows to the left, and <code>xfy</code>
operators where it grows to the right.  The tree cannot grow at all for
<code>xfx</code> operators; it is simply illegal to combine <code>xfx</code> operators having
equal precedences in this way.

   <p>The possible types for a prefix operator are:
     <ul>

     <li><code>fx</code>
<li><code>fy</code>
</ul>

   <p>and for a postfix operator they are:
<pre class="example">     <code>xf</code>
     
     <code>yf</code>
     </pre>

   <p>If these precedence and associativity rules seem rather complex,
remember that you can always use parentheses when in any doubt.
