<h4 class="subsection">Making the Window the Right Size</h4>

   <p>Make the window the right size for the message:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>win(Window),
             text_extents(Window, 'Hello, world!!', L, R, W,
                     Ascent, Descent),
             Width is W+4,
             Height is Ascent+Descent+4,
             put_window_attributes(Window, [size(Width,Height)]),
             TextLeft is L+2,
             TextBase is Ascent+2.</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568),
     L = 0,
     R = 145,
     W = 146,
     Ascent = 17,
     Descent = 3,
     Width = 150,
     Height = 24,
     TextLeft = 2,
     TextBase = 19
     </pre>

   <p>First we retrieve our window.  The second line, the call to
<code>text_extents/7</code>, computes how big the message is when printed in the
window.  The first argument to <code>text_extents/7</code> is a specification of
the font we are using.  Here, since we've already specified the font to
use for drawing into this window, the window uniquely determines the
font.  So ProXL accepts the window in place of the font argument.

   <p>This unique determination of argument types is an important concept. 
ProXL tries to infer the right object from the object you give it.  In
this case, it wants a font, but it accepts a window.  Previously, we
associated a font with this window, so ProXL knows which font we mean. 
The table in <a href="pxl-bas-inf.html#pxl-bas-inf">pxl-bas-inf</a> spells out which entities are
predictable.

   <p>Returning to our example, the remaining arguments to
<code>text_extents/7</code> are:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><var>Msg</var>
     <dd>the string whose size we're trying to find

     <br><dt><var>L</var>
     <dd>left bearing: the number of pixels this string will occupy
left of the origin

     <br><dt><var>R</var>
     <dd>right bearing: the number of pixels this string will occupy right
of the origin

     <br><dt><var>W</var>
     <dd>total width

     <br><dt><var>Ascent</var>
     <dd>the number of pixels above the origin

     <br><dt><var>Descent</var>
     <dd>the number of pixels below the origin
</dl>

   <p>The next two goals compute the width and height of the window.  We
allow 2 pixels of blank space all around the string, yielding the 4
pixels we add in to determine both width and height.  Note that the
height of a string is its ascent plus it descent.

   <p>In the fifth line, we specify the new size for the window as we did
before, only now with a more precise size.

   <p>The last two lines compute the origin point for drawing into the
window.  <var>TextLeft</var> allows 2 pixels to the left of the string, and
<var>TextBase</var> leaves 2 pixels above.  For this tutorial, we'll just
remember these results and use them when needed.  In an actual program,
we would pass them as arguments to the program doing the drawing.

   <p>Notice that resizing the window erases our <code>Hello, world!!</code>
message.  This points up an important aspect of X:  it is <em>always</em>
the responsibility of the application to refresh its windows.  Later
we'll worry about making that work automatically; for now, just manually
refresh the window:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>win(Window),
          draw_string(Window, 2, 19, 'Hello, world!!').</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568)
     </pre>

   <p>There shouldn't be any surprises here.  The position (2,19) simply
the TextLeft and TextBase we computed earlier.
