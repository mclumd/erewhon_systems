<h4 class="subsection">Introduction</h4>

   <p>The family of assertion and retraction predicates described below
enables you to modify a Prolog program by adding or deleting clauses
while it is running.  These predicates should not be overused.   Often
people who are experienced with other programming languages have a tendency
to think in terms of global data structures, as opposed to data structures
that are passed as procedure arguments, and hence they make too much use
of assertion and retraction.  This leads to less readable and less
efficient programs.

   <p>An interesting question in Prolog is what happens if a procedure modifies
itself, by asserting or retracting a clause, and then fails.  On
backtracking, does the current execution of the procedure use new
clauses that are added to the bottom of the procedure?

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Historical note:</strong> In early releases of Quintus Prolog,
changes to the Prolog database became globally visible
upon the success of the built-in predicate modifying the database. 
An unsettling consequence was that the definition of a procedure could
change while it was being run.  This could lead to
code that was difficult to understand. 
Furthermore, the memory performance of the interpreter implementing
these semantics was poor.  Worse yet, the semantics rendered ineffective
the added determinacy detection available through indexing. 
</blockquote>

   <p>Quintus Prolog implements the "logical" view in updating dynamic
predicates.  This means that the definition of a dynamic procedure
that is visible to a call is effectively frozen when the call is
made.  A procedure always contains, as far as a call to it is
concerned, exactly the clauses it contained when the call was made.

   <p>A useful way to think of this is to consider that a call to a dynamic procedure
makes a <dfn>virtual copy</dfn> of the procedure and then runs the copy rather than
the original procedure.  Any changes to the procedure made by the call are
immediately reflected in the Prolog database, but not in the copy of the
procedure being run.  Thus, changes to a running procedure will not be visible
on backtracking.  A subsequent call, however, makes and runs a copy of the
modified Prolog database.  Any changes to the procedure that were made by an
earlier call will now be visible to the new call.

   <p>In addition to being more intuitive and easy to understand,
the new semantics allow interpreted code to execute
with the same determinacy detection (and excellent memory performance) as
static compiled code (see <a href="bas-eff-ind.html#bas-eff-ind">bas-eff-ind</a>, for more information on determinacy
detection).
