<h3 class="section">Examining Type Definitions at Runtime</h3>

   <p>The above described procedures should be sufficient for most needs. 
This module does, however, provide a few procedures to allow
programmers to access type definitions.  These may be a convenience
for debugging, or in writing tools to manipulate type definitions.

   <p>The following procedures allow programmers to find the definition
of a given type:
<pre class="example">         type_definition(<var>+Type</var>, <var>-Definition</var>)
         type_definition(<var>*Type</var>, <var>*Definition</var>)
         type_definition(<var>+Type</var>, <var>-Definition</var>, <var>-Size</var>)
         type_definition(<var>*Type</var>, <var>*Definition</var>, <var>*Size</var>)
     </pre>

   <p><var>Type</var> is an atom naming a type, <var>Definition</var> is the definition of that
type, and <var>Size</var> is the number of bytes occupied by a foreign term of
this type.  <var>Size</var> will be the atom <code>unknown</code> if the size of an object of
that type is not known.  Such types may not be used as fields in
structs or unions, or in arrays.  However, pointers to them may be
created.  If <var>Type</var> is not bound at call time, these procedures will
backtrack through all current type definitions.

   <p>A definition looks much like the definition given when the type was
defined with <code>type/1</code>, except that it has been simplified.  Firstly,
intermediate type names have been elided.  For example, if <code>foo</code> is
defined as <code>foo=integer</code>, and <code>bar</code> as <code>bar=foo</code>, then
<code>type_definition(bar, integer)</code> would hold.  Also, in the definition
of a compound type, types of parts are always defined by type names,
rather than complex specifications.  So if the type of a field in a
struct was defined as <code>pointer(fred)</code>, it will show up in the
definition as <code>'$fred'</code>.  Of course, <code>type_definition('$fred', pointer(fred))</code> would hold, also.

   <p>The following predicates allow the programmer to determine whether
or not a given type is atomic:
<pre class="example">         atomic_type(<var>+Type</var>)
         atomic_type(<var>*Type</var>)
     
         atomic_type(<var>+Type</var>, <var>-Primitive_type</var>)
         atomic_type(<var>*Type</var>, <var>*Primitive_type</var>)
     
         atomic_type(<var>+Type</var>, <var>-Primitive_type</var>, <var>-Size</var>)
         atomic_type(<var>*Type</var>, <var>*Primitive_type</var>, <var>*Size</var>)
     </pre>

   <p><var>Type</var> is an atomic type.  See <a href="str-fty.html#str-fty">str-fty</a> for the definition
of an atomic type.  <var>Primitive_type</var> is the primitive type that
<var>Type</var> is defined in terms of.  <var>Size</var> is the number of bytes
occupied by an object of type <var>Type</var>, or the atom <code>unknown</code>, as
above.  If <var>Type</var> is unbound at call time, these predicates will
backtrack through all the currently defined atomic types.
