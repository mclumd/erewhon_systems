   <p>Quintus Prolog uses three data areas:  program space, local stack space, and
global stack space.  Each of these areas is automatically expanded if it
overflows; if necessary, the other areas are shifted to allow this.

   <p>The local stack contains all the control information and variable bindings
needed in a Prolog execution.  Space on the local stack is reclaimed on
determinate success of predicates and by tail recursion optimization, as
well as on backtracking.

   <p>The global stack space contains the heap (also known as the global
stack) and the trail.  The heap contains all the data
structures constructed in an execution of the program, and the trail
contains references to all the variables that need to be reset when
backtracking occurs.  Both of these areas grow with forward execution
and shrink on backtracking.  These fluctuations can be monitored by
<code>statistics/[0,2]</code>.

   <p>The program space contains compiled and interpreted code, recorded terms,
and atoms.  The space occupied by compiled code, interpreted code,
and recorded terms is recovered when it is no longer needed; the
space occupied by atoms that are no longer in use can be recovered by
atom garbage collection described in <a href="ref-mgc-ago.html#ref-mgc-ago">ref-mgc-ago</a>.

   <p>Quintus Prolog uses the
heap to construct compound terms, including lists. 
Heap space is used as Prolog execution moves forward. 
When Prolog backtracks, it automatically reclaims space on the heap. 
However, if a program uses a large amount of space before failure and
backtracking occur, this type of reclamation may be inadequate.

   <p>Without garbage collection, the Prolog system must attempt to expand the heap
whenever a heap overflow occurs.  To do this, it first requests additional
space from the operating system.  If no more space is available, the Prolog
system attempts to allocate unused space from the other Prolog data areas. 
If additional space cannot be found, a resource error is raised.

   <p>Heap expansion and abnormal termination of execution due to lack of heap
space can occur even if there are structures in the heap that are no
longer accessible to the computation (these structures are what is meant by
"garbage").  The proportion of garbage to non-garbage terms varies
during execution and with the Prolog code being executed.  The heap may
contain no garbage at all, or may be nearly all garbage.

   <p>The  garbage collector periodically reclaims
inaccessible heap space, reducing the need for heap expansion and lessening
the likelihood of running out of heap.  When
the garbage collector is enabled (as it is by default), the system makes
fewer requests to the
operating system for additional space. 
The fact that less space is required from
the operating system can produce a substantial savings in the time taken to
run a program, because paging overhead can be much less.

   <p>For example, without garbage collection, compiling a file containing the
sequence
<pre class="example">     p(_) :- p([a]).
     :- p(_).
     </pre>

   <p>causes the heap to expand until the Prolog process eventually runs out of
space.  With garbage collection enabled, the above sequence
continues indefinitely.  The list built on the heap by each recursive
call is inaccessible to future calls (since <code>p/1</code> ignores its argument)
and can be reclaimed by the garbage collector.

   <p>Garbage collection does not guarantee freedom from out-of-space errors,
however.  Compiling a file containing the sequence
<pre class="example">     p(X) :- p([X]).
     :- p(a).
     </pre>

   <p>expands the heap until the Prolog process eventually runs out of
space.  This happens in spite of the garbage collector,
because all the terms built on the heap are accessible to
future computation and cannot be reclaimed.
