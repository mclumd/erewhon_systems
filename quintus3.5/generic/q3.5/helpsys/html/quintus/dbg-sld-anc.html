<h4 class="subsection">Seeing Ancestor Frames</h4>

   <p>The source linked debugger also provides a set of buttons to allow you
to view ancestor invocation frames.

<pre class="example">                     -+--------+----------+----------+
                      |Frame Up|Frame Down|Frame Back|
                     -+--------+----------+----------+
     </pre>

<div align="center">The Framing Buttons</div>

   <p>The <b>Frame Up</b> button will show you the invocation before the one
you are viewing.  That means that the arrow will point to the place
the invocation you are currently viewing was called from.  Repeatedly
hitting the Frame Up button will cause you to continue to traverse up
through parent invocations, eventually stopping at the goal you typed
at the top level prompt.

   <p>The <b>Frame Down</b> button may be used after you have framed up to
take you back down toward the current invocation frame.

   <p>The <b>Frame Back</b> button will immediately take you back to the
current invocation frame.  This may also be used when you have framed
up or scrolled the source window, and want to instantly scroll back to
show the current invocation frame, or even if you are viewing another
source file in the source window and want to get back.

   <p>In order to remind you when the goal you are viewing is not the
current invocation frame, the arrow shown in the source window is
hollow, or "ghosted", rather than the usual solid arrow.

<pre class="example">                                       |\
                               +-------+ \
                               |          &gt;
                               +-------+ /
                                       |/
     </pre>

<div align="center">Ghost Arrow Shows Ancestor Frame</div>

   <p>When you have framed up, certain travel buttons are interpreted relative
to the frame you are currently viewing.  <b>Skip</b> will skip over the
invocation you are viewing (this is very handy if you have accidentally
crept into a procedure you don't want to debug).  <b>Redo</b> and <b>Fail</b>
will take you to the call and fail ports of the selected invocation,
respectively.  All other travel buttons are disabled when you have
framed up.  You must either frame down or frame back in order to travel
from the current invocation.
