<h4 class="subsection">Modules and Loading through the Editor Interface</h4>

   <p>When you (re)load some Prolog code through the editor interface, the module
into which the code is to be loaded is selected as follows.
     <ul>

     <li>if the code begins with a module declaration, this is exactly the same as
loading that text from a file using the Load Predicates;
<li>otherwise, if the file containing the code has previously been associated
with some module other than <code>user</code>, the code is reloaded into that
module;
<li>otherwise, if the type-in module is <code>user</code>, the code is
loaded into <code>user</code>;
<li>otherwise, you are prompted to confirm that you wish to load the code into
the type-in module -- if not, the load is abandoned. 
</ul>

   <p>Note that when a fragment of code has been loaded into a particular module
other than <code>user</code>, the editor will subsequently insist that that
code belongs to that module.  In order to change this,
the entire module must be reloaded.

   <p>When a module declaration is processed, the module is reinitialized; all
predicates previously imported into that module are forgotten.  Therefore,
when only <em>part</em> of a module-file is reloaded through the editor
interface, that part should generally <em>not</em> include the module declaration.

   <p>Loading an entire module through the editor interface is like loading
the module via the Load Predicates in that all the public
predicates in the module are imported into the type-in module.  The
only difference is that in the case in which you load the module
through the editor interface you will be prompted for confirmation
before the importation takes place.  This is because there are
situations in which you might want to reload a module via the editor
interface without importing it into the type-in module; that is,
situations in which you would not want to allow the importation to
happen.  For example, suppose that the type-in module is the default
<code>user</code>, and that you have been modifying a module <code>m1</code> from which
another module <code>m2</code> imports predicates, but from which <code>user</code> does
not import anything.  In this case, you may want to reload <code>m1</code>, using
the editor interface, without importing it into <code>user</code>.

   <p>When a file that is not a module-file is loaded into several different
modules, reloading all or part of it through the editor interface affects
only the module into which it was most recently loaded.
