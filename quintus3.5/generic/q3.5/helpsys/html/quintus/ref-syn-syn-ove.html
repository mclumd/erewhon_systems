<h5 class="subsubsection">Overview</h5>

   <p>A Prolog program consists of a sequence of <dfn>sentences</dfn>.  Each
sentence is a Prolog <dfn>term</dfn>.  How sentences are interpreted as
terms is defined in <a href="ref-syn-syn-sen.html#ref-syn-syn-sen">ref-syn-syn-sen</a>, below.  Note that a
term representing a sentence may be written in any of its equivalent
syntactic forms.  For example, the functor <code>:-/2</code> could be written
in standard prefix notation instead of as the usual infix operator.

   <p>Terms are written as sequences of <dfn>tokens</dfn>.  Tokens are sequences
of characters, which are treated as separate symbols.  Tokens include
the symbols for variables, constants, and functors, as well as
punctuation characters such as parentheses and commas.

   <p>The interpretation of sequences of tokens as terms is defined in
<a href="ref-syn-syn-trm.html#ref-syn-syn-trm">ref-syn-syn-trm</a>.  Each list of tokens that is read in (for
interpretation as a term or sentence) must be terminated by a

   <p><dfn>full-stop</dfn> (a period followed by a layout character such as newline or
space) token. Two tokens must be separated by a <dfn>space</dfn>
if they could otherwise be interpreted as a single token.  Both
spaces and <dfn>comment</dfn>s are ignored when interpreting
the token list as a term.  A comment may appear at any point in a
token list (separated from other tokens by spaces where necessary).

   <p>The interpretation of tokens as sequences of characters is defined on
<a href="ref-syn-syn-tok.html#ref-syn-syn-tok">ref-syn-syn-tok</a>.   The next section describes
the notation used in the formal definition of Prolog syntax.
