<h4 class="subsection">Using Quintus Objects</h4>

   <p>One of the basic ideas of object-oriented programming is the
encapsulation of data and procedures into objects. Each object belongs
to exactly one class, and an object is referred to as an instance of
its class. A class definition determines the following things for its
objects:

     <ul>

     <li>slots, where an object holds data
<li>messages, the commands that can be sent to an object
<li>methods, the procedures the object uses to respond to the messages
</ul>

   <p>All interaction with an object is by sending it messages. The command
to send a message to an object has the form

<pre class="example">     <var>Object</var> <var>MessageOp</var> <var>Message</var>
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>Object</var> is an object, <var>MessageOp</var> is one of the message
operators (<code>&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;&gt;</code>, or <code>&lt;-</code>) and <var>Message</var> is a message
defined for the object's class.  Roughly speaking, the <code>&gt;&gt;</code> message
operator is used for extracting information from an object, <code>&lt;&lt;</code> is for
storing information into an object, and <code>&lt;-</code> is for any other sort
of operation.

   <p>For example, using the point class defined in the next section, it
would be possible to give the following command, which demonstrates
all three message operators.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create(point, PointObj),
          PointObj &gt;&gt; x(InitX),
          PointObj &gt;&gt; y(InitY),
          PointObj &lt;&lt; x(2.71828),
          PointObj &lt;&lt; y(3.14159),
          PointObj &lt;- print(user),
          nl(user).</kbd>
     
     (2.71828,3.14159)
     PointObj = point(23461854),
     InitX = 1.0,
     InitY = 2.0
     </pre>

   <p>First it binds the variable
<code>PointObj</code> to a newly created <code>point</code> object. Then, the two get messages (sent with the <code>&gt;&gt;</code>
operator) fetch the initial values of the point's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots, binding
the variables <code>InitX</code> and <code>InitY</code> to these values.  Next, the two
put messages (sent with the <code>&lt;&lt;</code> operator) assign new values to
the object's <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> slots. Finally, the send message (sent with the
<code>&lt;-</code> operator) instructs the point object to print itself to the
<code>user</code> stream, followed by a newline.  Following the goal, we see
the point has been printed in a suitable form.  Following this, the values of
<code>PointObj</code>, <code>InitX</code>, and <code>InitY</code> are printed as usual
for goals entered at the Prolog prompt.

   <p>Because this goal is issued at the Prolog prompt, the values of the
variables <code>PointObj</code>, <code>InitX</code> and <code>InitY</code> are not retained after
the command is executed and their values are displayed, as with any
goal issued at the Prolog prompt.  However, the
point object still exists, and it retains the changes made to its
slots. Hence, objects, like clauses
asserted to the Prolog database, are more persistent than Prolog variables.

   <p>Another basic idea of object-oriented programming is the notion of
inheritance. Rather than defining each class separately, a new class
can inherit the properties of a more general superclass. Or, it can be
further specialized by defining a new subclass, which inherits its
properties. (C++ uses the phrase "base class" where we use
"superclass." It also uses "derived class" where we use "subclass.")

   <p>Quintus Objects uses term expansion to translate object-oriented
programs into ordinary Prolog. (This is the same technique that Prolog
uses for its DCG grammar rules.) As much as possible is done at
compile time. Class definitions are used to generate Prolog clauses
that implement the class's methods. Message commands are translated into
calls to those Prolog clauses.  And, inheritance is resolved at
translation time.

   <p>Quintus Objects consists of two modules, <code>obj_decl</code> and <code>objects</code>. The
<code>obj_decl</code> module is used at compile time to translate the
object-oriented features of Quintus Objects. Any file that defines
classes or sends messages should include the command

<pre class="example">     :- load_files(library(obj_decl),
                   [when(compile_time), if(changed)]).
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>objects</code> module provides runtime support for Quintus Objects
programs. A file that sends messages or asks questions about what
classes are defined or to what class an object belongs should include
the command:

<pre class="example">     :- use_module(library(objects)).
     </pre>

   <p>You will probably include both in most files that define and use classes.

   <p>You must have a license to use the <code>obj_decl</code> module, but you may
include the <code>objects</code> module in programs that you will distribute.
