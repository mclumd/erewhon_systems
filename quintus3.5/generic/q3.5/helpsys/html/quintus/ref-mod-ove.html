<h4 class="subsection">Overview</h4>

   <p>The module system lets the user divide large Prolog programs into
<dfn>modules</dfn>, or rather smaller sub-programs, and define
the interfaces between those modules.  Each module has its own name
space; that is, a predicate defined in one module is distinct from any
predicates with the same name and arity that may be defined in other
modules.  The module system encourages a group of programmers to
define the dependence each has on others' work before any code is
written, and subsequently allows all to work on their own parts
independently.  It also helps to make library predicates behave as
extensions of the existing set of built-in predicates.

   <p>The Quintus Prolog library uses the module system and can therefore serve as
an extended example of the concepts presented in the following text.  The
design of the module system is such that loading library files and calling
library predicates can be performed without knowledge of the module system.

   <p>Some points to note about the module system are that:
     <ul>

     <li>It is based on predicate modularity rather than on data
modularity; that is, atoms and functors are global.

     <li>It is flat rather than hierarchical; any module may
refer to any other module by its name --
there is no need to specify a path of modules. 
<li>It is not strict; modularity rules can be explicitly overridden.  This is
primarily for flexibility during debugging. 
<li>It is efficient; calls to predicates across module boundaries incur
little or no overhead. 
<li>It is compatible with previous releases of Quintus Prolog;
existing Prolog code should run unchanged. 
</ul>
