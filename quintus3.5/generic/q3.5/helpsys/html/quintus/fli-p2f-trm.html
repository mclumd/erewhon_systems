</ul>

   <p>This section describes passing Prolog terms to a foreign function and
receiving Prolog terms from a foreign function. For the current release
this interface is supported only for C.

   <p>There is a difference between passing atomic objects (atoms, floats,
db_reference and integers) and generic Prolog terms through the
foreign interface.  Generic Prolog terms passed to a C function (using
<code>+term</code>) are not converted to any representation in C. Instead the
foreign function in C gets a reference to the Prolog term, which is of
type <code>QP_term_ref</code> (defined in <code>&lt;quintus/quintus.h&gt;</code>). 
Similarly when a generic term is returned (using <code>-term</code> or <code>[-term]</code>)
from a foreign function there is no conversion of any data structures
in the foreign language into an equivalent Prolog representation. The
foreign function has to return a reference to a Prolog term, which it
originally got from Prolog or from one of the functions/macros
provided to manipulate Prolog terms such as the <code>QP_put*</code> and
<code>QP_cons*</code> families of functions.

   <p>When Prolog terms are referred to from C, what the C function holds
is an indirect reference to the Prolog term. There is a reason
for this indirection. Prolog terms live in the Prolog global
stack, and migrate when Prolog does garbage collection
or stack shifting. If the C function held onto a direct reference
to a Prolog term it would become invalid after one of these
memory management operations.  Prolog cannot update and relocate
these references that C is holding onto since it is impossible to
distinguish between Prolog references and other integers and
pointers that C holds onto.

   <p>The C code should also be aware of the scope (or lifetime) of the
references to Prolog terms passed to it. Once you return
to Prolog from a call to a foreign function, all the references to Prolog
terms passed to the foreign function are invalid. All references to
terms created by the foreign function are also invalid.

   <blockquote>

        <p><em>WARNING:</em> You should not store references to prolog terms into
global variables in the foreign language. 
</blockquote>

   <p>The scope of references to terms are more restricted when C calls Prolog. 
If Prolog returns a term as a result of a C call to a Prolog predicate,
that term is valid only till the call for the next solution from that
Prolog predicate (using <code>QP_next_solution()</code>). 
This also holds true for terms created in C. If you create a term after one
call to a Prolog predicate then the reference to that term is only valid
till the call for next solution from that Prolog predicate.
