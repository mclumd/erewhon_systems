<h4 class="subsection">Introduction</h4>

   <p>ProXT is a Prolog interface to the Motif widget set and the X Toolkit
(Xt).  Widgets are ready-made graphical components for building
user-interfaces, for example, menus, dialog boxes, scroll bars and
command buttons. The X Toolkit provides routines for creating and
using such widgets. ProXT provides access from Prolog to all the
widgets in Motif and to the Xt routines necessary for using the
widgets.

   <p>ProXT permits the rapid development of user-interfaces with the Motif
"look and feel". The interactive development environment of Prolog
greatly shortens the edit-test-debug cycle.  Individual files can be
recompiled incrementally, avoiding the need to exit the application
and re-link it. In addition, ProXT provides the programmer with a more
logical view of the Motif widget set and reinforces its
object-oriented nature.

   <p>Almost all of the predicates in ProXT are interfaced directly to
functions from the underlying C interface. Also, there is a
straightforward correspondence between the data structures used: for
example ProXT expects a list where Xt expects an array.  This makes it
very easy to switch between writing Prolog code for ProXT and C code
for Xt and Motif. In addition, ProXT can readily be used in
conjunction with C code written for Motif and Xt.

   <p>ProXT is not available under Windows.
