<h5 class="subsubsection">Color and colormaps</h5>

   <p>A color is a triple of Red, Green, Blue values.  Each <dfn>pixel</dfn>, or
point, in a window or pixmap may be a different color.  On each hardware
platforms, there will be a restriction on the number of colors that may
be displayed in a window at a time, and also a limitation on the number
of different colors that are possible at all.  For example, many screens
are capable of showing approximately 16 million colors (256 different
shades each of red, green, and blue), but can only show 256
colors at one time.  This means that <dfn>pixel values</dfn>, the numbers
assigned to each pixel, will be between 0 and 255.  Each window,
therefore, must have a way to know what color is associated with each
pixel value.  This is what a <dfn>colormap</dfn> does:  it maps from pixel
values to actual colors.

   <p>Notice that a colormap is associated with each window, but not with
pixmaps.  The pixel values in a pixmap are uninterpreted until the
pixmap is copied to a window.  So a pixmap copied into two different
windows may appear in different colors if those windows have different
colormaps.
