<h5 class="subsubsection">Objects</h5>

   <p>The <code>class_of/2</code> predicate is used to test whether an object is of a
particular type or to determine the type of an object. Similarly, the
<code>descendant_of/2</code> predicate relates an object to all ancestors of its
class. (Remember that the object's class is, itself, an ancestor class
of the object.)

   <p>Both require the first argument (the object) to be instantiated. That
is, the predicates cannot be used to find objects of a given class. If
you need to search among all the objects of a class, you must provide
a way to do it. One way to do this is to assert a fact connecting the
class name to every object, when it is created. The named_point
example of the previous section took that idea a step further by
allowing each object to have a different name.

   <p>The <code>pointer_object/2</code> predicate relates an object's address (a pointer)
to the object. Remember that an instance of <var>Class</var> is represented by a
term of the form

<pre class="example">     <var>Class</var>(<var>Address</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>pointer_object/2</code> predicate requires that one of its arguments be
instantiated, but it may be either one. Hence, just by knowing the
address of an object (which possibly was returned by a foreign
function) it is possible to determine the object's type.

   <p>Most Prolog programmers can safely ignore the <code>pointer_object/2</code>
predicate, unless they are using Quintus Objects with foreign
functions or with the Structs package.
