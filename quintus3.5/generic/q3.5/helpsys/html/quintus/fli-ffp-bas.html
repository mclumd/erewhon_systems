   <p>Quintus Prolog provides tools making it possible to call Prolog
predicates from foreign languages.  This is useful for a
number of reasons.
     <ul>

     <li>In the simplest case, a foreign function may want to get at
information that is contained in the Prolog database.  It might be
inconvenient or unnatural for the foreign function to return to
Prolog, Prolog to query its database and reinvoke foreign code. 
<li>Foreign functions might also want to make use of Prolog's
inferencing capabilities, again without having to contort algorithms. 
<li>When Quintus Prolog is embedded in another application, that
application invokes Prolog by calling it from foreign functions.  This
aspect of calling Prolog from foreign functions will be handled fully
in the section on embedding Prolog (see <a href="fli-emb.html#fli-emb">fli-emb</a>). 
</ul>

   <p>To take advantage of Quintus Prolog's ability to be called from
foreign functions, you must first know how to do either of the following:
     <ul>

     <li> load foreign code into Quintus Prolog; see <a href="fli-p2f.html#fli-p2f">fli-p2f</a>
<li> embed Quintus Prolog in another application; see <a href="fli-emb.html#fli-emb">fli-emb</a>
</ul>

   <p>Currently, only functions written in C can call Prolog predicates
directly; this restriction may be lifted in future releases of Quintus
Prolog.  However, other languages such as Pascal and FORTRAN can call
Prolog by virtue of their ability to call C. 
 foreign
code!)  calls Prolog.  The FORTRAN and Pascal stuff will then help
users call the C functions.  It just wasn't making sense writing all
of this in terms of generic "foreign languages", because I knew full
well I'd have to eventually do something different for FORTRAN and
Pascal.  While this should be more clear for release 3, it may as a result
require more rewriting in case we ever do make Prolog directly
callable from FORTRAN and Pascal.}

   <p>The interface between C and Prolog supports direct exchange of
Prolog's atomic data types (atoms, integers or database reference). 
The data is automatically converted between Prolog's internal
representation and the internal representation of the foreign
language.  The interface also supports passing any Prolog term from C
and returning any Prolog term to C.
