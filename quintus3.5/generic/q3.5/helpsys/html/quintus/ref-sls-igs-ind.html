<h5 class="subsubsection">The Initialization Declaration</h5>

   <p>The <code>initialization/1</code> predicate is an important complement to the
embedded directive construct <code>:- </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> appearing in
a file being consulted or compiled, and can in many cases not only
replace the directive, but also make the code work better when used in
stand-alone programs and runtime systems.

   <p>The main reason for this is that <code>:- </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> directive is executed
at compile-time, not when the file in which the construct occurs is
actually loaded into a running system. This causes no problems within
development systems, but if we want to save states and
compile programs into qof-files, link them together, and later start
them up again,  problems arise because:

     <ul>

     <li>The <code>:- </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> construct calls <var>Goal</var> only
once, when the file is compiled, not when a saved state containing the
file is restored. 
<li><var>Goal</var> is called at compile-time, which means
that if you use <code>qpc</code> to compile source code into a qof-file, your
directives will be run during this compilation, not when you load the
qof-file or start up a stand-alone system to which the qof-file has
been linked. 
</ul>

   <p>The <code>initialization/1</code> predicate,
on the other hand, provides a way of letting initialization
routines be called when a file is actually loaded or a system
containing the file is started up.  This allows for correct initialization
in stand-alone programs and runtime systems; therefore a recommended
programming style is to use <code>initialization/1</code> instead of a bare
<code>:- </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> construct whenever appropriate.

   <p>In the following figure, <var>Goal_1</var> might typically be
an operator declaration and <var>Goal_2</var>, an initialization predicate that
modifies the database.

<div align="center">Embedded directives (<var>goal_1</var>) vs. initialized goals (<var>goal_2</var>)</div>

   <p>The initialization goal, <var>Goal_2</var>, is defined to be run when:
     <ul>

     <li>        a source file with a <code>:- initialization </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> directive
is loaded into a running system (using compile, consult etc.) 
<li>        a stand-alone program or runtime system is started up,
and some file linked to
the system had a <code>:- initialization </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> directive. If several
files had such directives, the order in which the goals are run is not
defined. 
<li>        a saved state is restored, and some file loaded to the saved system
had a <code>:- initialization </code><var>Goal</var><code></code> directive, or
<code>initialization(</code><var>Goal</var><code>)</code> was called before the state was saved. 
 If several
initialization goals were defined in the system, the order in which they
are run upon a restore is not defined. 
<li>        a QOF file is loaded into a running system,
and the source file that was compiled into the qof file had a
<code>(:- initialization </code><var>Goal</var><code>)</code> directive. 
</ul>
