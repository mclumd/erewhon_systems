<h4 class="subsection">Use of the Profiler</h4>

   <p>The execution of a goal can be profiled using <code>profile/1</code>, which takes
the goal as its argument. This will turn on the profiler, recording for
each invoked predicate the number of calls, choice points created, redos
tried and the predicate's callers. Counts accumulated from any previous
executions of the profiler will be reset. 
The goal is then executed with timing information additionally monitored.

   <p>Once the goal has completed execution, the results of the execution profile
can be seen by calling the <code>show_profile_results/2</code> builtin predicate. The
first argument to <code>show_profile_results/2</code> is the <em>display mode</em> and is
one of the atoms: <code>by_time</code>, <code>by_calls</code>, <code>by_choice_points</code> or
<code>by_redos</code>. This determines how the output is sorted and what the percent
figure that is printed relates to. For example, if the argument is <code>by_time</code>
then the results are sorted according to the time spent in the predicates (in
descending order) and the percentage figure is the proporation of
total execution time spent executing that predicate.

   <p>The second argument gives the number of procedures to show information about,
thus a value of 10 means that the top ten predicates are printed. 
The predicate <code>show_profile_results/1</code> is equivalent to
<code>show_profile_results/2</code> with second argument given a value of 10 and
similarly <code>show_profile_results/0</code> is equivalent to
<code>show_profile_results/1</code> with the argument <code>by_time</code>.

   <p>The following example illustrates the output of <code>show_profile_results/2</code>:

   <p>The output lists the predicate name, the number of calls to that predicate,
number of times a choice point was created, the number of the times the
predicate was retried on backtracking and the time (in seconds) spent
executing that predicate.  The percentage figure depends on the display mode. 
In the example above 15.3% of the goal calls were to <code>satisfy/1</code>, but
only 5.3% of the execution time was spent in <code>satisfy/1</code>.

   <p>Then follows the list of callers, showing for each caller the predicate
name and arity, the clause number and the call number within that
clause of the call (see <a href="mpg-ref-add_spypoint.html#mpg-ref-add_spypoint">mpg-ref-add_spypoint</a>), followed by the number of
calls made by this caller and the percentage of execution time attributed to
this caller.

   <p>Notice in the example that more callers are shown for <code>satisfy/1</code> when
the profile results are listed <code>by_calls</code> than <code>by_time</code>. Callers that do
not register any time are not listed in the output when displayed <code>by_time</code>. 
Callers are omitted in a similar way for other display modes when the relevant
count is zero.

   <p>The profiler can be turned off with the <code>noprofile/0</code> predicate.
