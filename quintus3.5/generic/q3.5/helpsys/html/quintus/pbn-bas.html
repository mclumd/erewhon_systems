<h3 class="section">Introduction</h3>

   <p>PrologBeans is a package for integrating Java and Prolog applications. 
The main idea is to let Java and Prolog run in separate processes.  It
is usually a bad idea to let Java and Prolog coexist in the same
process, as their respective virtual machines tend to compete over
resources such as memory and UNIX signals.

   <p>The current version of the package is designed to be used when Java
applications need to send queries to a Prolog server (and less intended
for showing a GUI from a Prolog program). One typical application is to
connect Java based web applications to a Prolog server (see examples
later).

PrologBeans setup where the Prolog application serves several users accessing both via a web application server and a Java GUI.

   <p>The PrologBeans package is split into the file <code>prologbeans.jar</code>,
to be used in the Java application, and the
<code>library(prologbeans)</code> module, to be used in the Prolog part of
the application, i.e. the <dfn>Prolog server</dfn>.

   <p>All PrologBeans examples can be found in the
<code>qplib('prologbeans/demo')</code> directory, which is one of the
directories covered by the <code>demo</code> file search path.
