<h4 class="subsection"><code>initialization/1</code> <dfn>declaration</dfn></h4>

<h4 class="subheading">Synopsis</h4>

   <p><code>:- initialization </code><var>Goal</var><code></code>

   <p>Declares that <var>Goal</var> is to be run when the file in which the
declaration appears is loaded into a running system, or when a
stand-alone program or runtime system that contains the file is started
up.

<h4 class="subheading">Arguments</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><var>Goal</var> <dfn>callable</dfn> [MOD]
     <dd>A valid goal. 
</dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Description</h4>

   <p>Defined as built-in prefix operator, so a simplified
syntax can be used when using <code>initialization/1</code> as a directive. See
examples.

   <p>Callable at any point during compilation of a file. That is, it can be
used as a directive, or as part of a goal called at compile-time.  The
initialization goal will be run as soon as the loading of the file is
completed. That is at the end of the load, and notably after all other
directives appearing in the file have been run.

   <p><code>qpc</code> and <code>save_program/[1,2]</code> save initialization goals in the QOF
file, so that they will run when the qof file is loaded.

   <p><var>Goal</var> is associated with the file loaded, and with a module, if
applicable.  When a file, or module, is going to be reloaded, all
goals earlier installed by that file or in that module, are
removed.  This is done before the actual load, thus allowing a new
initialization <var>Goal</var> to be specified, without creating duplicates.

<h4 class="subheading">Exceptions</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>instantiation_error</code>
     <dd>
    The argument <var>Goal</var> is not instantiated
</dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Examples</h4>

   <p>To understand the examples fully, read the
reference page on <code>volatile/1</code> first.

   <p>A common case is when the Prolog process at start up should connect
itself to an external database. It should also make the connection when the
file with the code for the connection is loaded for the first time.
<pre class="example">     :- volatile db_connection/1.
     :- initialization my_init.
     
     my_init :-
       ( clause(db_connection(_), _) -&gt;
         true
       ; set_up_connection(Connection),
         assert(db_connection(Connection))
       ).
     </pre>

   <p>In the above example, <code>set_up_connection/1</code> is user defined. 
We do not declare <code>db_connection/1</code> as
dynamic in the file, since such a declaration would implicitly delete
all clauses of the predicate when the file is reloaded.

   <p>It might not always be desirable to have the connection set up the
first time the file is loaded, but only when a system is started up (for
instance during the debugging of a database application.) This
can be achieved with the following code (note that we use the property
that a dynamic declaration reinitiliazes/resets the declared predicate):
<pre class="example">     :- dynamic connect/0.
     :- volatile db_connection/1.
     :- initialization my_init.
     
     my_init :-
       ( connect -&gt;
         set_up_connection(Connection),
         assert(db_connection(Connection))
       ; assert(connect)
       ).
     </pre>
