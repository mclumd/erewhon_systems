     <dl>

     <br><dt><dfn>abolish</dfn>
     <dd>To abolish a <dfn>predicate</dfn> is to <dfn>retract</dfn> all the
predicate's <dfn>clauses</dfn> and to remove all information
about it from the Prolog system, to make
it as if that predicate had never existed.  <dfn>Built-in
predicates</dfn> cannot be abolished, but user-defined ones
always can be, even when <dfn>static</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>absolute filename</dfn>
     <dd>A name of a file giving the absolute location
of that file. 
Under UNIX and Windows, Quintus Prolog considers filenames beginning with
<code>/</code> or <code>~</code> absolute. 
Under Windows, filenames beginning with a letter followed
by <code>:</code> are also considered absolute. 
All other filenames are considered <dfn>relative</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>alphanumeric</dfn>
     <dd>An alphanumeric character is any of the lowercase
characters from <code>a</code> to <code>z</code>, the uppercase characters from <code>A</code> to <code>Z</code>, or the
numerals from <code>0</code> to <code>9</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>ancestor</dfn>
     <dd>An ancestor of a <dfn>goal</dfn> is any goal that the
system is trying to solve when it calls that goal.  The most distant
ancestor is the goal that was typed at the top-level prompt.

     <br><dt><dfn>anonymous</dfn>
     <dd>An anonymous <dfn>variable</dfn> is one that has no unique
name, and whose value is therefore inaccessible.  An anonymous variable is
denoted by an underscore (_).

     <br><dt><dfn>archive file</dfn>
     <dd>A file containing an <dfn>object code</dfn> library
that can be statically linked into programs. 
Sometimes called <dfn>static library</dfn>. 
Archive files have an operating system dependent extension, which is:
          <dl>

          <br><dt>Windows:
          <dd><code>.lib</code>
By convention, Quintus Prolog uses the suffix <code>s.lib</code> (e.g.,
<code>libqps.lib</code>) since a <code>.lib</code> is also used for Windows DLL
import libraries.

          <br><dt>UNIX:
          <dd>samp{.a}
</dl>

     <br><dt><dfn>argument</dfn>
     <dd>See <dfn>predicate</dfn>, <dfn>structure</dfn>, and <dfn>arity</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>arity</dfn>
     <dd>The arity of a <dfn>structure</dfn> is its number of <dfn>argument</dfn>s. 
For example, the structure <code>customer(jones, 85)</code> has an arity of 2.

     <br><dt><dfn>atom</dfn>
     <dd>A character sequence used to uniquely denote
some
entity in the problem domain.  A number is <em>not</em> an atom.  Examples of legal
atoms are:
     <pre class="example">          hello   *   '#$%'   'New York'   'don''t'
          </pre>

     <p><strong>Please note:</strong>  An atom may not start with a capital letter or underscore
unless that atom is
enclosed in single quotes.  Character sequences that include spaces must
also be enclosed in single quotes.  To include a single quote in an atom,
print it twice in succession for each single quote that is to appear.  See
the <a href="ref-syn-trm-ato.html#ref-syn-trm-ato">ref-syn-trm-ato</a>  for a complete definition of an atom.

     <br><dt><dfn>atomic term</dfn>
     <dd>Synonym for <dfn>simple term</dfn> or <dfn>constant</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>backtracking</dfn>
     <dd>The process of reviewing the <dfn>goal</dfn>s that have been
satisfied and attempting to resatisfy these goals by finding alternative
solutions.

     <br><dt><dfn>binding</dfn>
     <dd>The process of assigning a value to a <dfn>variable</dfn>; used
in <dfn>unification</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>body</dfn>
     <dd>The body of a <dfn>clause</dfn> consists of the part of a Prolog
clause following the <code>:- </code> symbol.

     <br><dt><dfn>buffer</dfn>
     <dd>A temporary workspace in Emacs that contains a file
being edited.

     <br><dt><dfn>built-in predicate</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>predicate</dfn> that comes with the system and
that does not have to be explicitly <dfn>consult</dfn>ed or <dfn>compile</dfn>d before
it is used.

     <br><dt><dfn>clause</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>fact</dfn> or a <dfn>rule</dfn>.  A rule comprises a
<dfn>head</dfn> and a <dfn>body</dfn>.  A fact consists of a head only, and is equivalent
to a rule with the body <code>true</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>command</dfn>
     <dd>An instruction for the Prolog system to perform an action
involving <dfn>side-effects</dfn>.  If the command is written preceded by a
<code> :- </code>, it will be executed as a <dfn>directive</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>compile</dfn>
     <dd>Load a program (or a portion thereof) into Prolog through
the
compiler.  Compiled code runs more quickly than interpreted code, but you
cannot debug compiled code in as much detail as interpreted code.

     <br><dt><dfn>compound term</dfn>
     <dd>See <dfn>structure</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>connective</dfn>
     <dd>a logical <dfn>term</dfn>, or a symbol thereof, that relates
components in such a way that the truth or falsity of the resulting statement
is determined by the truth or falsity of the components. 
For example,
     <pre class="example">          :-     ;     ,
          </pre>

     <p>stand for the connectives <code>if</code>, <code>or</code>, and <code>and</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>constant</dfn>
     <dd>An integer (for example:  1, 20, -10), a floating-point
number (for example:  12.35), or an <dfn>atom</dfn> (for example:  <code>'New York'</code>). 
Constants are also known as <dfn>simple term</dfn>s, and
are recognized by the Prolog predicate <code>atomic/1</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>consult</dfn>
     <dd>Load a program (or a portion thereof) into Prolog through
the
interpreter.  Interpreted code runs more slowly than compiled code, but you
can debug interpreted code in more detail than compiled code.

     <br><dt><dfn>creep</dfn>
     <dd>What the debugger does in <dfn>trace</dfn> mode, also known as
single-stepping.  It goes to the next <dfn>port</dfn> of a <dfn>procedure</dfn> box and
prints the <dfn>goal</dfn>, then prompts you for input.  See <a href="dbg-bas-bas.html#dbg-bas-bas">dbg-bas-bas</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>cross-reference</dfn>
     <dd>A notation in the text of the manual, pointing
to another section of the manual containing related information.  In
the on-line manual, these are of the form {<var>manual</var>(<var>Tag</var>)}, as in
"see {manual(int-man-ove)}."  Typing the text between the braces
into the Prolog system will cause the text of the referenced section
to be displayed.

     <br><dt><dfn>cursor</dfn>
     <dd>The point on the screen at which typed characters appear. 
This is usually highlighted by a line or rectangle the size of one space,
         which may or may not blink.

     <br><dt><dfn>cut</dfn>
     <dd>Written as <code>!</code>.  A <dfn>built-in predicate</dfn> that succeeds when
encountered; if <dfn>backtracking</dfn> should later return to the cut, the <dfn>goal</dfn>
that matched the <dfn>head</dfn> of the <dfn>clause</dfn> containing the cut fails
immediately.

     <br><dt><dfn>database</dfn>
     <dd>The Prolog database comprises all of the <dfn>clause</dfn>s
that have been <dfn>load</dfn>ed into the Prolog system via <code>compile/1</code>,
<code>consult/1</code>, or that have been asserted, excepting those clauses that
have been removed by <code>retract/1</code> or <code>abolish/[1,2]</code>

     <br><dt><dfn>debug</dfn>
     <dd>A mode of <dfn>program</dfn> execution in which the debugger
stops to print the current <dfn>goal</dfn> only at <dfn>procedures</dfn> that
have <dfn>spypoints</dfn> set on them (see <dfn>trace</dfn>).

     <br><dt><dfn>determinate</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>procedure</dfn> is determinate if it can supply
only one answer.

     <br><dt><dfn>directive</dfn>
     <dd>A directive is a <dfn>command</dfn> preceded by the prefix
operator <code>:- </code>, whose intuitive meaning is "execute this as a command,
but do not print out any variable bindings."

     <br><dt><dfn>disjunction</dfn>
     <dd>A series of <dfn>goal</dfn>s connected by the <dfn>connective</dfn>
"or" (that is, a series of goals whose principal <dfn>operator</dfn> is <code>|</code> or <code>;</code>).

     <br><dt><dfn>dynamic predicate</dfn>
     <dd>A predicate that can be modified while a
<dfn>program</dfn> is
running.  A <dfn>predicate</dfn> must explicitly be declared to be dynamic or it must
be added to the <dfn>database</dfn> via one of the assertion predicates.

     <br><dt><dfn>environment variable</dfn>
     <dd>A variable known to the command interpreter
environment.  Most programs can be controlled to some extent by
environment variables.  The syntax for setting environment variables
in command interpreter dependent.  For example, (A) would be
appropriate for <code>csh(1)</code> and <code>tcsh(1)</code>; (B) for <code>sh(1)</code>,
<code>bash(1)</code>, and <code>ksh(1)</code>; (C) for Windows
<code>cmd.exe</code>. 
Under Windows, it is often preferable to set environment variables globally
in the System control panel.

     <pre class="example">          % <kbd>setenv PROLOGINITSIZE 2M</kbd> (A)
          % <kbd>export PROLOGINITSIZE=2M</kbd> (B)
          % <kbd>SET PROLOGINITSIZE=2M</kbd> (C)
          </pre>

     <br><dt><dfn>export</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>module</dfn> exports a <dfn>procedure</dfn> by making that
procedure <dfn>public</dfn>, so that other modules can <dfn>import</dfn> it.

     <br><dt><dfn>fact</dfn>
     <dd>(Also called a <dfn>unit clause</dfn>.)  A <dfn>clause</dfn> with no
<dfn>conditions</dfn>--that is, with an empty <dfn>body</dfn>.  A fact is a
statement that a relationship exists between its <dfn>arguments</dfn>.  Some
examples, with possible interpretations, are:
     <pre class="example">          king(louis, france).   % Louis was king of France.
          have_beaks(birds).     % Birds have beaks.
          employee(nancy, data_processing, 55000).
                               % Nancy is an employee in the
                               % data processing department.
          </pre>

     <p>An integer number assigned to a file when it is opened, and then used as a
unique identifier in I/O operations.

     <br><dt><dfn>first-order logic</dfn>
     <dd>A system of logic in which the values of
<dfn>variables</dfn> may range over the data items in the domain.  In Prolog these
data items are <dfn>terms</dfn>.  For comparison, in zero-order logic (also known
as propositional logic) there are no variables, and in second-order logic
the values of variables are allowed to range both over data items and over
functions and relations.

     <br><dt><dfn>functor</dfn>
     <dd>The name and <dfn>arity</dfn> of a <dfn>structure</dfn>.  For
example, the
structure <code>foo(a, b)</code> is said to have "the functor foo of arity two",
which is generally written <code>foo/2</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>garbage collection</dfn>
     <dd>The freeing up of space for computation by
making the space occupied by <dfn>terms</dfn> that are no longer available
for use by the Prolog system.

     <br><dt><dfn>goal</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>procedure</dfn> call.  When called, it will either succeed or
fail.  A
goal typed at the top level is called a <dfn>query</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>head</dfn>
     <dd>The head of a <dfn>clause</dfn> is the single <dfn>goal</dfn> that will
be satisfied if the <dfn>conditions</dfn> in the <dfn>body</dfn> (if any)
are true; the part of a <dfn>rule</dfn> before the <code>:- </code> symbol.  The head of
a <dfn>list</dfn> is the first element of the list.

     <br><dt><dfn>home directory</dfn>
     <dd>Your default directory upon login.  Under UNIX,
this is the value of the <code>HOME</code> environment variable.  Under
Windows, it is the directory specified by the environment variables
<code>HOMEDRIVE</code> and <code>HOMEPATH</code>. 
You can ask Quintus Prolog what it considers to be you home directory by typing
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>absolute_file_name(~, HomeDir).</kbd>
          </pre>

     <br><dt><dfn>Horn clause</dfn>
     <dd>See <dfn>clause</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>import</dfn>
     <dd><dfn>Public</dfn> <dfn>procedures</dfn> in a <dfn>module</dfn> can be imported by
other modules.  Once a procedure has been imported
by a module, it can be called as if it were defined in that module.

     <p>There are two kinds of importation:  procedure-importation, in
which only specified procedures are imported from a module; and
module-importation, in which all the predicates made public by
a module are imported.

     <br><dt><dfn>instantiation</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>variable</dfn> is instantiated if it is <dfn>bound</dfn> to
a non-variable <dfn>term</dfn>; that is, to an <dfn>atomic term</dfn> (see <dfn>constant</dfn>)
or a <dfn>compound term</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>interpret</dfn>
     <dd>Load a <dfn>program</dfn> or set of <dfn>clauses</dfn> into Prolog
through the interpreter (also known as <dfn>consulting</dfn>).  Interpreted code
runs much more slowly than <dfn>compiled</dfn> code, but more extensive facilities
are available for debugging interpreted code.

     <br><dt><dfn>leap</dfn>
     <dd>What the debugger does in <dfn>debug</dfn> mode.  The debugger
shows only
the <dfn>ports</dfn> of <dfn>procedures</dfn> that have <dfn>spypoints</dfn> on them. It then
        prompts you for input, at which time you may leap again to the
        next spypoint.  See <a href="dbg-bas-tra-spy.html#dbg-bas-tra-spy">dbg-bas-tra-spy</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>leashing</dfn>
     <dd>Determines how frequently the debugger will stop
and prompt you for input when you are <dfn>tracing</dfn>.  A <dfn>port</dfn>
at which the debugger stops is called a "leashed port."

     <br><dt><dfn>list</dfn>
     <dd>A list is written as a set of zero or more <dfn>term</dfn>s
between square
brackets.  If there are no terms in a list, it is said to be empty, and is
written as [].  In this first set of examples, all members of each list
are explicitly stated.
     <pre class="example">          [aa, bb,cc]  [X, Y]  [Name]  [[x, y], z]
          </pre>

     <p>In the second set of examples, only the first several members of each list
are explicitly stated, while the rest of the list is represented by a
<dfn>variable</dfn> on the right-hand side of the "rest of" operator, <code>|</code>:

     <pre class="example">          [X | Y]  [a, b, c | Y]  [[x, y] | Rest]
          </pre>

     <p><code>|</code> is also known as the "list constructor."  The first element of the list
to the left of <code>|</code> is called the <dfn>head</dfn> of the list.  The rest of the
list,
including the variable following <code>|</code> (which represents a list of any length),
is called the <dfn>tail</dfn> of the list.

     <p>For example,
     <pre class="example">          <b>list              head        tail</b>
          [X | Y]           X           Y
          [a, b, c | y]     a           [b, c | y]
          [[X, Y] | Rest]   [X, Y]      Rest
          </pre>

     <br><dt><dfn>load</dfn>
     <dd>To <dfn>compile</dfn> or <dfn>consult</dfn> a Prolog <dfn>clause</dfn> or set of
clauses.

     <br><dt><dfn>meta-predicate</dfn>
     <dd>A meta-predicate is one that calls one or more of
its <dfn>arguments</dfn>; more generally, any <dfn>predicate</dfn> that needs to assume
some <dfn>module</dfn> in order to operate is called a meta-predicate.

     <p>A meta-predicate declaration is a <dfn>term</dfn> in a <dfn>module-file</dfn> that
is associated with a given <dfn>functor</dfn>, sharing its <dfn>name</dfn> and
<dfn>arity</dfn>, but having each of its <dfn>arguments</dfn> replaced either by one
of the mode annotations <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>+-</code>, <code>+*</code>, or by <code>:</code> or a
non-negative integer.  <code>:</code> or a non-negative integer signifies that
the corresponding argument requires module name expansion.

     <br><dt><dfn>mode line</dfn>
     <dd>The information line at the bottom of each Emacs
<dfn>window</dfn> that is one line long and the width of the screen; often shown in
reverse video.  The mode line at the bottom of the Prolog window says "Quintus Prolog"
plus other information such as the state of the debugger if it is activated. 
The mode line of the text window(s) states the <dfn>buffer</dfn>name, the filename,
the editor mode ("Prolog" for a file ending in <code>.pl</code>), and the percentage
of the file that precedes the <dfn>cursor</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>module</dfn>
     <dd>A module is a set of <dfn>procedures</dfn> in a <dfn>module-file</dfn>. 
Some procedures in a module
are <dfn>public</dfn>.  The default module is <code>user</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>module-file</dfn>
     <dd>A module-file is a file that is headed
with a <dfn>module</dfn> declaration of the form
     <pre class="example">          :- module(<var>ModuleName, PublicPredList</var>).
          </pre>

     <p>which must appear as the first <dfn>term</dfn> in the file.

     <br><dt><dfn>multifile predicate</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>predicate</dfn> whose definition is to be
spread over more than one file. Such a predicate must be preceded by an
explicit multifile declaration in the first file containing <dfn>clauses</dfn> for
it.

     <br><dt><dfn>name clash</dfn>
     <dd>A name clash occurs when a <dfn>module</dfn> attempts to
define or <dfn>import</dfn> a <dfn>procedure</dfn> that it has
already defined or imported.

     <br><dt><dfn>object code</dfn>
     <dd>The machine-executable, as opposed to the
human-readable, representation of a <dfn>program</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>object file</dfn>
     <dd>A file containing <dfn>object code</dfn>. 
Object files have an operating system dependent extension, which is:
          <dl>

          <br><dt>Windows:
          <dd><code>.obj</code>

          <br><dt>UNIX:
          <dd>samp{.o}
</dl>

     <br><dt><dfn>operator</dfn>
     <dd>A notational convenience that allows you to
express
any <dfn>compound term</dfn> in a different format.  For example, if "likes" in
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>likes(sue, cider).</kbd>
          </pre>

     <p>is declared an infix operator, the query above could be written:
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>sue likes cider.</kbd>
          </pre>

     <p>An operator does not have to be associated with a <dfn>predicate</dfn>.  However,
certain <dfn>built-in predicates</dfn> are declared as operators.  For example,
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>=..(X, Y).</kbd>
          </pre>

     <p>can be written as
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>X =.. Y.</kbd>
          </pre>

     <p>because <code>=..</code> has been declared an infix operator.

     <p>Those predicates that correspond to built-in operators are written using
infix notation in the list of built-in predicates at the beginning of the
part that contains the reference pages.

     <p>Some built-in operators do <em>not</em> correspond to built-in predicates; for
example, arithmetic operators.  <a href="ref-syn-ops-bop.html#ref-syn-ops-bop">ref-syn-ops-bop</a> contains a list
of built-in operators.

     <br><dt><dfn>parent</dfn>
     <dd>The <dfn>parent</dfn> of the current <dfn>goal</dfn> is a goal that, in
its attempt to obtain a successful solution to itself, is calling the
current goal.

     <br><dt><dfn>port</dfn>
     <dd>One of the four key points of interest in the
execution of a Prolog <dfn>procedure</dfn>.  There are four ports: the Call
port, representing the initial invocation of the procedure; the Exit
Port, representing a successful return from the procedure; the Redo
port, representing reinvocation of the procedure through
<dfn>backtracking</dfn>; and the Fail port, representing an unsuccessful
return due to the failure of the initial <dfn>goal</dfn> of the procedure.

     <br><dt><dfn>precedence</dfn>
     <dd>A number associated with each Prolog <dfn>operator</dfn>, which
is used to disambiguate the structure of the term represented
by an expression containing a number of operators.  Operators of lower
precedence
are applied before those of higher precedence; the operator with the
highest precedence is considered the principal <dfn>functor</dfn> of the
expression.  To disambiguate operators of the same
precedence, the associativity type is also necessary.  See the
syntax chapter (<a href="ref-syn.html#ref-syn">ref-syn</a>).

     <br><dt><dfn>predicate</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>functor</dfn> that specifies some relationship
existing in the problem domain.  For example, <code>&lt;/2</code> is a
built-in <dfn>predicate</dfn>
specifying the relationship of one number being less than another.  In
contrast, the functor <code>+/2</code> is not (normally used as) a predicate.

     <p>A predicate is either <dfn>built-in</dfn> or is implemented by a <dfn>procedure</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>procedure</dfn>
     <dd>A set of <dfn>clauses</dfn> in which the <dfn>head</dfn> of each
clause has the same <dfn>predicate</dfn>.  For instance, a group of clauses of the
following form:
     <pre class="example">          connects(san_francisco, oakland, bart_train).
          connects(san_francisco, fremont, bart_train).
          connects(concord, daly_city, bart_train).
          </pre>

     <p>is identified as belonging to the procedure <code>connects/3</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>program</dfn>
     <dd>A set of <dfn>procedures</dfn> designed to perform a given task.

     <br><dt><dfn>public</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>procedure</dfn> in a <dfn>module</dfn> is public if it can be
<dfn>imported</dfn> by other modules.  The public predicates of a module are listed
in the module declaration (see <dfn>module-file</dfn>).

     <br><dt><dfn>QOF file</dfn>
     <dd>a fully general way of storing arbitrary Prolog facts
and rules in a form that can be quickly and easily used.  QOF files contain a
machine independent representation of both compiled and dynamic Prolog
predicates.  This means they are completely portable between different
platforms running Quintus Prolog.

     <br><dt><dfn>query</dfn>
     <dd>
          <ul>
<li><dfn>simple query</dfn>:   A query is a question
put by the user to the
Prolog system.  A simple query is written as a <dfn>goal</dfn> followed by a
<dfn>full-stop</dfn> in response to the Prolog system prompt.  For example,
          <pre class="example">               | ?- <kbd>father(edward, ralph).</kbd>
               </pre>

          <p>refers to the <dfn>predicate</dfn> <code>father/2</code>.  If a query has no <dfn>variable</dfn>s
in it, the system will respond either <code>yes</code> or <code>no.</code> If a query contains
variables, the system will try to find values of those variables for which
the query is true.  For example,
          <pre class="example">               | ?- <kbd>father(edward, X).</kbd>
               X = ralph
               </pre>

          <p>After the system has found one answer, the user can direct the system to look
for additional answers to the query by typing <kbd>; &lt;RET&gt;</kbd>.

          </p><li><dfn>compound query</dfn>:   A compound query consists of two or more simple
queries connected by commas.  For a compound query to be true, all of
its <dfn>goal</dfn>s must be
true simultaneously.  For example, the following compound query will find
Ralph's grandfather (G):
          <pre class="example">               | ?- <kbd>father(G, F), father(F, ralph).</kbd>
               </pre>

          <p><code>F</code> is a shared <dfn>variable</dfn> that is constrained by <dfn>unification</dfn> to have
the same value in each of the two subgoals. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><dfn>quintus-directory</dfn>
     <dd>The root directory of the entire Quintus
Prolog file hierarchy.  Used by Prolog executables
to relocate certain relative file names. 
Is the value of the <code>quintus_directory</code> Prolog flag. 
See <a href="int-dir.html#int-dir">int-dir</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>recursion</dfn>
     <dd>The process in which a running <dfn>procedure</dfn>
calls itself, presumably with different <dfn>arguments</dfn> and for the
purpose of solving some subset of the original problem.

     <br><dt><dfn>region</dfn>
     <dd>The text between the  <dfn>cursor</dfn> and a previously-set
mark in an Emacs buffer.

     <br><dt><dfn>relative filename</dfn>
     <dd>A name of a file giving the location of that
file relative to the
working directory.  See <dfn>absolute filename</dfn> about
differentiating absolute filenames from relative ones.

     <br><dt><dfn>rule</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>clause</dfn> with one or more <dfn>conditions</dfn>. 
For a rule to be true, all of its conditions must also be true.  For example,
     <pre class="example">          has_stiff_neck(ralph) :-
             hacker(ralph).
          </pre>

     <p>This rule states that if the individual <code>ralph</code> is a hacker, then he must
also have a stiff neck.  The <dfn>constant</dfn> <code>ralph</code> is replaced in
     <pre class="example">          has_stiff_neck(X) :-
             hacker(X).
          </pre>

     <p>by the <dfn>variable</dfn> X.  X <dfn>unifies</dfn>
with anything, so this rule can be used to prove that any hacker has a
stiff neck.

     <br><dt><dfn>runtime-directory</dfn>
     <dd>A platform-specific directory containing
Quintus Prolog executables, object files and the like. 
Is the value of the <code>runtime_directory</code> Prolog flag. 
See <a href="int-dir.html#int-dir">int-dir</a>.

     <br><dt><dfn>saved-state</dfn>
     <dd>A snapshot of the state of Prolog saved in a
file by <code>save_program/1</code>, <code>save_modules/2</code>, or <code>save_predicates/2</code>. 
<code>save_program/1</code> saves the whole Prolog data base, <code>save_modules/2</code>
and <code>save_predicates/2</code> save a list of modules and predicates respectively.

     <br><dt><dfn>semantics</dfn>
     <dd>The relation between the set of Prolog symbols and
their combinations (as Prolog <dfn>terms</dfn> and <dfn>clauses</dfn>), and their meanings. 
Compare <dfn>syntax</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>static library</dfn>
     <dd>See <dfn>shared object file</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>shared object file</dfn>
     <dd>A file containing <dfn>object code</dfn>
that can be dynamically loaded into programs. 
Sometimes called <dfn>shared library</dfn>. 
Shared object files have an operating system dependent extension, which is:
          <dl>

          <br><dt>Windows:
          <dd><code>.dll</code>

          <br><dt>HPUX:
          <dd>samp{.sl}

          <br><dt>other UNIX:
          <dd>samp{.so}
</dl>

     <br><dt><dfn>side-effect</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>predicate</dfn> that produces a side-effect is one
that has any effect on the "outside world"
(the user's terminal, a file, etc.),
or that changes the Prolog <dfn>database</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>simple term</dfn>
     <dd>see <dfn>constant</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>source code</dfn>
     <dd>The human-readable, as opposed to the
machine-executable, representation of a <dfn>program</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>spypoint</dfn>
     <dd>A flag placed on a <dfn>predicate</dfn> by the
command <code>spy/1</code> and removed by <code>nospy/1</code> that tells the debugger
to stop
execution and allow user interaction at <dfn>goals</dfn> for that predicate.  Any
number of predicates can have spypoints set on them.

     <br><dt><dfn>static library</dfn>
     <dd>See <dfn>archive file</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>static predicate</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>predicate</dfn> that can be modified only by being
reloaded
via the <dfn>consult</dfn> or <dfn>compile</dfn> facility or by being <dfn>abolish</dfn>ed. 
  (See <dfn>dynamic predicate</dfn>.)

     <br><dt><dfn>stream</dfn>
     <dd>An input/output channel.

     <br><dt><dfn>structure</dfn>
     <dd>(Also called a <dfn>compound term</dfn>.)  A
structure is a <dfn>functor</dfn> together with zero or more <dfn>argument</dfn>s.  For
example, in the structure
     <pre class="example">          father(X)
          </pre>

     <p><code>father/1</code> is the functor, and X is the first and only argument.  The argument
to a structure can be another structure, as in
     <pre class="example">          father(father(X))
          </pre>

     <br><dt><dfn>syntax</dfn>
     <dd>The part of Prolog grammar dealing with the way in which
symbols are put together to form legal Prolog <dfn>terms</dfn>.  Compare
 <dfn>semantics</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>term</dfn>
     <dd>A basic data object in Prolog.  A term can be
a <dfn>constant</dfn>, a <dfn>variable</dfn>, or a <dfn>structure</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>trace</dfn>
     <dd>A mode of <dfn>program</dfn> execution in which the debugger
single-steps to the next <dfn>port</dfn> and prints the <dfn>goal</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>unbound</dfn>
     <dd>A <dfn>variable</dfn> is unbound if it has not yet been
<dfn>instantiated</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>unification</dfn>
     <dd>The process of matching a <dfn>goal</dfn> with the <dfn>head</dfn>
of a <dfn>clause</dfn>
during the evaluation of a <dfn>query</dfn>, or of matching arbitrary terms with
one another during <dfn>program</dfn> execution.  A goal unifies with the head of a
clause if 1) they have the same <dfn>functor</dfn>,
and 2) all of the <dfn>argument</dfn> <dfn>term</dfn>s can be unified.  The rules governing
the unification of terms are:
          <ul>

          <li>Two <dfn>constant</dfn>s unify with one another if they are identical. 
<li>A <dfn>variable</dfn> unifies with a <dfn>constant</dfn> or a <dfn>structure</dfn>.  As a result
of the unification, the variable is <dfn>instantiated</dfn> to the constant or
structure. 
<li>A variable unifies with another variable.  As a result of the unification,
they become the same variable. 
<li>A structure unifies with another structure if they have the same functor
and if all of the arguments can be unified. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><dfn>unit clause</dfn>
     <dd>See <dfn>fact</dfn>.

     <br><dt><dfn>variable</dfn>
     <dd>Logical variable. 
A logical variable is a name that stands for objects
that may or may not be determined at a specific point in a Prolog <dfn>program</dfn>. 
When the object for which the variable stands is determined in the Prolog
program, the variable becomes instantiated (see <dfn>instantiation</dfn>). 
A logical variable may be unified (see <dfn>unification</dfn>) with a <dfn>constant</dfn>,
a <dfn>structure</dfn>, or another variable.  Variables become uninstantiated when
the procedure they occur in backtracks (see <dfn>backtracking</dfn>)
past the point at which they were instantiated.

     <p>A variable is written as a single word (with no intervening spaces)
beginning either with a
capital letter without quotes, or with the character <code>_</code>.  Examples:
     <pre class="example">          X   Y   Z   Name   Position   _c   _305  One_stop
          </pre>

     <br><dt><dfn>volatile</dfn>
     <dd>Predicate property.  The clauses of a volatile
predicate are not saved by in QOF files by the Prolog <code>save</code>
predicates.  However, they are saved by <code>qpc</code>.

     <br><dt><dfn>window</dfn>
     <dd>Under the Emacs interface, a region of the terminal screen. 
There are two types of window:  the Prolog window, of which there is exactly
one, and the the text window, of which there are one or more.  Each window
has a <dfn>mode line</dfn> at the bottom, and each text window displays the
contents of one file.
