<h5 class="subsubsection">Exiting Emacs</h5>

   <p>You can exit from the editor in either of two ways:  you can stop
the current editor job and exit irreversibly, or you can
temporarily suspend the current editor job.  If you are finished with your
session, you will probably want to exit irreversibly, as described
in this section. 
If you want to temporarily halt your session, return to the
command prompt, and later be able to resume your session, you should exit
as described in the next section.

   <p><em>To exit from the editor irreversibly</em>, type the following:
<pre class="example">     <kbd>^x ^c</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>If you try to exit while you have a Prolog session
running, the system displays the following message at the bottom of
the screen:

<pre class="example">     Active processes exist; kill them and exit anyway? (yes or no)
     </pre>

   <p>To end the Prolog session, type <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>yes</kbd>, and press &lt;RET&gt;.  If
you don't want to end the Prolog session, type <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>no</kbd> and
press &lt;RET&gt; to abort the exit.  Prolog will continue running.

   <p>If you try to exit and you have files that have been modified but not
saved, you will receive a message at the bottom of the
screen to prompt you to save each modified file.

   <p>If you want to save the files before you exit, type <kbd>n</kbd> and press
&lt;RET&gt; to abort the exit.  Move the cursor to the text window (if it's
not already there), and use the <kbd>^x ^s</kbd> command to save
the information from the window into a file.  If you want to exit
without saving the modified information, type <kbd>y</kbd> and press &lt;RET&gt;,
and you will be returned to the main operating system prompt.
