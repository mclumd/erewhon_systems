<h5 class="subsubsection">Slots</h5>

   <p>A class's slots are a combination of those explicitly defined in its
slot description list and the slots it inherits from its
superclass. In Quintus Objects, a class inherits all the slots of its
superclass. It follows that a class inherits all the slots of all its
ancestors.

   <p>The programmer's control over inheritance of slots is limited. It is
not possible to rename an inherited slot, nor is it possible to change
its type, unless it is a class slot. It is possible to change a slot's
initial value. And, it is possible to effectively change a slot's
visibility.

   <p>To change the initial value or the type (when allowed) of a slot,
include a new <var>SlotDef</var> in the list of slot descriptions for the class,
with the same slot name and a new type or initial value. The type of a
class slot
can only be changed to a subclass of the type of the superclass's
slot. The new initial value must still be a constant of the
appropriate type.

   <p>The <code>named_point</code> class, defined earlier, could have better been defined
from the point class, which began as follows:

<pre class="example">     :- class point =
             [public x:float=0,
              public y:float=0].
     </pre>

   <p>The definition of the <code>named_point</code> class would then begin with

<pre class="example">     :- class named_point =
             [public name:atom,
              public x:float=1.0] + point.
     </pre>

   <p>This <code>named_point</code> class has public slots named <code>name</code>, <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>, with the same types and initial values as the earlier
<code>named_point</code> definition, which did not use inheritance.  This
<code>named_point</code> class also inherits all the methods of the <code>point</code>
class, which saves us from having to write them again (and maintain them).

   <p>A slot that was private or protected in a superclass may be defined as
public. This will cause get and put methods to be generated in the
subclass. A slot that was public in a superclass may be defined as
protected or private, but this does not prevent it from inheriting the get and
put methods of the superclass. For that, the <code>uninherit/1</code>
directive, defined below, is
needed.
