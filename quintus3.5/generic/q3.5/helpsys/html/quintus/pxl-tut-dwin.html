<h4 class="subsection">Displaying a Window on the Screen</h4>

   <p>First, let's put up a window.  Type the command, 'prolog', into a shell
window running under the X window system, and load the ProXL
library:

<pre class="example">     % <kbd>prolog</kbd>
     
     Quintus Prolog Release 3.5 (Sun 4, SunOS 5.5)
     
     | ?- <kbd>[library(proxl)].</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>You will be greeted with many messages about files being loaded, and
finally will get another Prolog prompt.  Now let's create a window:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create_window(Window, [mapped(true)]),
          retractall(win(_)),
          assert(win(Window)).</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568)
     </pre>

   <p>After a few moments, a window should appear on your screen.  Some
window managers may require you to choose a position for the window.

   <p>That's all there is to putting a window on the screen.  You will notice
that we didn't specify very much.  We didn't say how big to make the
window, nor where on the screen to put it, nor what color to make it,
etc.  All these parameters, and many more, are defaulted for us by
ProXL.  The only thing we did specify was <code>mapped(true)</code>. In X,
<dfn>mapping</dfn> a window makes it visible if its parent window is visible. 
Since we didn't specify a parent window for the window we're creating,
the root window of the default screen is its parent, and the root window
is always mapped.  So by specifying the attribute <code>mapped(true)</code>, we
make the new window visible.

   <p>The second argument of <code>create_window/2</code> is a list; this is called an
<dfn>attribute</dfn> list.  We could have put many different attributes in
this list, to specify any of the attributes of the window mentioned
above as having been defaulted.  A complete list of the attributes
supported by windows can be found in <a href="pxl-win.html#pxl-win">pxl-win</a>, but
for this example we won't need to use very many of them.

   <p>We use <code>assert/1</code> to remember the window we've created so that we can
use it later.  This is a good idea while you are experimenting with
ProXL, but isn't usually necessary in actual programs.  Using
<code>retractall/1</code> to initialize the table first is just standard Prolog
wisdom, avoiding any problems if this tutorial is run more than once.

   <p>Notice that this window is quite small; the default window size is 100
by 100 pixels.  If we're going to display a message in this window,
we'll need it to be bigger.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>win(Window),
          put_window_attributes(Window, [size(250,100)]).</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568)
     </pre>

   <p>This makes the window 250 by 100 pixels, more than big enough for our
purposes.  The call to <code>win/1</code> gets back the window we just created, and
<code>put_window_attributes/2</code> changes the window's size.

   <p><code>put_window_attributes/2</code> is much like <code>create_window/2</code>, except
that it allows you to specify new attributes for an existing window,
and <code>create_window/2</code> lets you specify attributes for a window to be
newly created.  We could have specified <code>size(250,100)</code> in the call
to <code>create_window/2</code>, if we had thought of it then.

   <p>If you try this, one of two things may happen:  the window may be
changed to the right size, or it may not.  The reason is that X allows
the window manager to have control over top level window sizes and
positions.  An application can try to change these things, but the
window manager decides whether to allow it or not.  The theory behind
this is that the <em>user</em> should be in control of his windows, and the
window manager is his tool in implementing his wishes.  If this last
goal didn't work for you, don't worry.  Try to get your window manager
to give the test window enough space for the message, and ignore the
fact that the message isn't centered.  The final version of this
program will center the message.
