<h4 class="subsection"><code>multifile/1</code> <dfn>declaration</dfn></h4>

<h4 class="subheading">Synopsis</h4>

   <p><code>:- multifile </code><var>+PredSpecs</var><code></code>

   <p>Allows the clauses for the specified predicates to be in more than one file.

<h4 class="subheading">Arguments</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><var>PredSpecs</var> <dfn>pred_spec_forest</dfn> [MOD]
     <dd>A single predicate
specification of the form <var>Name/Arity</var>, or a sequence of
predicate specifications separated by commas.  <var>Name</var> must be an
atom and <var>Arity</var> an integer in the range 0..255.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Description</h4>

   <p>A built-in prefix operator, so that declarations can be written as
e.g.
<pre class="example">      :- multifile a/1, b/3.
     </pre>

   <p>By default, all clauses for a predicate are expected to come from just
one file.  This assists with reloading and debugging of code. 
Declaring a predicate <code>multifile</code> means that its clauses can be
spread across several different files.  This is independent of whether
or not the predicate is declared <code>dynamic</code>.

   <p>Should precede all the clauses for the specified predicates in the
file.

   <p>There should be a <code>multifile</code> declaration for a predicate <var>P</var>
in every file that contains clauses for <var>P</var>.  This restriction is
not currently enforced in the Development System: for compatibility
with earlier releases it suffices to have a <code>multifile</code> declaration
in the first file loaded that contains clauses for <var>P</var>.  However,
a warning is noted if the <code>multifile</code> declaration is omitted in
subsequent files.  The <code>multifile</code> declarations <em>must</em> be
included in every file when <code>qpc</code> is being used to compile files
separately.

   <p>If a <code>multifile</code> predicate is dynamic, there should be a <code>dynamic</code>
declaration in every file containing clauses for the predicate.  Again, this is
not enforced in the Development System, for backwards compatibility, but
warnings are printed if the <code>dynamic</code> declarations are omitted. 
The <code>dynamic</code> declarations may not be omitted when <code>qpc</code> is being used to
compile files separately.

   <p>When a file containing clauses for a <code>multifile</code> predicate (<var>P</var>) is
reloaded, the clauses for <var>P</var> that previously came from that file are
removed.  Then the new clauses for <var>P</var> (which may be the same as the old
ones) are added to the end of the definition of the <code>multifile</code> predicate. 
An exception to this is when the file concerned is the pseudo-file <code>user</code>,
meaning that clauses are being entered from the terminal; in this case the
clauses are always added to the end of the predicate without removing any
previously defined clauses.

   <p>If a <code>multifile</code> declaration is found for a predicate that has already been
defined in another file (without a <code>multifile</code> declaration), then this is
considered to be a redefinition of that predicate.  Normally this will result
in a multiple-definition style-check warning (see <code>style_check/1</code>).

   <p>The predicate <code>source_file/2</code> can be used to find all the files containing
clauses for a <code>multifile</code> predicate.

   <p><code>multifile</code> predicates can be extended at run-time using
<code>multifile_assertz/1</code>.

   <p><code>multifile/1</code> cannot be called as a built-in predicate.  It can only be used
as a declaration to the compiler in a Prolog source file.

<h4 class="subheading">Exceptions</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>instantiation_error</code>
     <dd>
<var>PredSpecs</var> not ground.

     <br><dt><code>type_error</code>
     <dd>
Either name or arity in PredSpec has the wrong type

     <br><dt><code>domain_error</code>
     <dd>
<var>Arity</var> not in the range 0..255.

     <br><dt><code>context_error</code>
     <dd>
If the declaration contradicts previous declaration or clauses for the
same predicate in the file.

   </dl>
