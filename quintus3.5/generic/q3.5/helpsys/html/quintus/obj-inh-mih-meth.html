<h5 class="subsubsection">Methods</h5>

   <p>By default, all methods are inherited from all superclasses. Any of
the superclasses' methods can be uninherited, as described earlier, by
using the <code>uninherit/1</code> directive.

   <p>If the same message is defined for more than one superclass, however,
you must choose at most one method to inherit for the message. You may
choose none. You may do this by defining a new method for the message
(shadowing the superclasses' methods), or by using the <code>uninherit/1</code>
directive, or by using the <code>inherit/1</code> directive.

   <p>The following is considered a classic example of multiple inheritance.

<pre class="example">     :- class toy.             % no slots in this class
     
     Self &gt;&gt; size(small).
     
     Self &gt;&gt; rolls(false).
     
     :- end_class toy.
     
     :- class truck.         % no slots in this class
     
     Self &gt;&gt; size(large).
     
     Self &gt;&gt; rolls(true).
     
     :- end_class truck.
     </pre>

   <p>The idea expressed in these definitions is that most toys are small
and do not roll.  On the other hand, most trucks are large, but they do
roll. A toy truck shares one feature with each class, but we can
hardly expect a compiler to choose the correct one.

   <p>The definition of a new class, toy_truck, might begin with

<pre class="example">     :- class toy_truck = toy + truck.
     </pre>

   <p>Rather than redefine the get methods for <code>size</code> and <code>rolls</code>, we can
specify which to inherit in two ways. One way is positive, stating
which to inherit, and the other way is negative, stating which not to
inherit.

   <p>The positive version would be

<pre class="example">     :- inherit
             toy &gt;&gt; (size/1),
             truck &gt;&gt; (rolls/1).
     </pre>

   <p>This is more convenient when a message is defined in several
superclasses, because all but the chosen method are uninherited. And,
it is probably easier to understand.

   <p>The negative version would be

<pre class="example">     :- uninherit
             toy &gt;&gt; (rolls/1),
             truck &gt;&gt; (size/1).
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>toy_truck</code> class would exhibit the same behavior with either
definition.

   <p>It is possible to define methods that access the shadowed or
uninherited methods of the superclasses, by sending the message to
the superclasses. In the case of multiple inheritance, however, it may
be necessary to specify which superclass to send the message to.

   <p>The <code>toy_truck</code> class, for example, might define these methods:

<pre class="example">     Self &gt;&gt; uninherited_size(S) :-
             super(truck) &gt;&gt; size(S).
     
     Self &gt;&gt; uninherited_rolls(R) :-
             super(toy) &gt;&gt; rolls(R).
     </pre>

   <p>They provide access to the unchosen methods from <code>toy_truck</code>'s superclasses.

   <p>While these examples with the toy_truck class are clearly "toy"
examples, the same techniques can be used in more realistic cases.
