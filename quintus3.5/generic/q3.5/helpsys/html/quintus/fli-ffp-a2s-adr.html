<h5 class="subsubsection">Passing Addresses</h5>

   <p>Previous releases of Quintus Prolog had the restriction that integers
of greater than 29 bits could not be represented as Prolog integers. 
Certain platforms, however, have pointers that use some of the four
most significant bits; for these machines, pointers could not be
represented as Prolog integers.  This problem motivated the <code>address</code>,
which could be treated specially, as a distinct data type that can be
passed through the foreign interface.

   <p>With release 3 the restriction of integers to 29 bits has been
lifted; however, the internal representation of integers of more than
29 bits is more bulky and somewhat slower to manipulate than that of
smaller integers.  While this is not a problem in normal programs, it
could penalize programs that manipulate pointers in Prolog on certain
platforms whose pointers require more than 29 bits.  We have
chosen to retain the address data type in release 3 so that such
penalties can be avoided where possible, as well as for backward
compatibility.  Addresses can be passed both to and from Prolog from
foreign functions, and to and from foreign functions from Prolog. 
(See <a href="fli-p2f-poi.html#fli-p2f-poi">fli-p2f-poi</a>.)

   <p>As when calling foreign code from Prolog, pointers should be passed
through the interface using the type specification

<pre class="example">     address(<var>typename</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>as described in more detail below.  <var>typename</var> should be the name
used in the foreign language to identify the type of object named by
the pointer.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +address(<var>typename</var>)
     C:       <var>typename</var> *x;
     </pre>

   <p>The C pointer is converted to a 32-bit Prolog integer, which is passed
   to the Prolog call.  If the C pointer contains garbage when it is
   passed, Prolog will receive that garbage as an integer.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -address(<var>typename</var>)
     C:       <var>typename</var> **x;
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a C pointer is passed to the foreign interface. 
   When Prolog returns a solution, a Prolog integer is expected in the
   corresponding argument of the call.  If the argument is 0, the
   foreign function writes the NULL pointer at the location supplied. 
   Otherwise, the foreign interface converts the integer into a C pointer
   and writes it at the location. 
   The previous contents of the location will be destroyed.  If the
   Prolog call does not return an integer in the appropriate position,
   a type error is signaled and the contents of the location is undefined.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +address
     C:       char *x
     </pre>

   <p>This is equivalent to <code>+address(char)</code>.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -address
     C:       char **x
     </pre>

   <p>This is equivalent to <code>-address(char)</code>.

   <p>Using <code>+address</code> in place of <code>+address(</code><var>typename</var><code>)</code>, or <code>-address</code> in place of
<code>-address(</code><var>typename</var><code>)</code>, has no effect on the execution of the program;
however, doing so can reduce the readability of the program and
compromise program checking tools.
