<h4 class="subsection">Drawing a Textured Background</h4>

   <p>The window would look more interesting with a textured background. 
We decide that a 4x4 pixmap with two lines between
opposite corners forming an X would make an interesting background
texture.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>create_pixmap(Pix, [size(4,4)]),
             draw_segments(Pix, [segment(0,0,3,3), segment(0,3,3,0)]),
             win(Window),
             put_window_attributes(Window, [background(Pix)]).</kbd>
     
     Pix = pixmap(2383840),
     Window = window(2376568)
     </pre>

   <p>The first line is as simple as it looks: it creates a 4x4 pixel
pixmap.  The second line draws the X.  Note that coordinates are given
with (0,0) as the northwest corner pixel, so (3,3) is the southeast
corner.  Then the third line installs the new pixmap as the background
pattern.

   <p>You might be wondering why the window didn't change.  The reason is
simple:  the background is used to fill parts of the window
that have been cleared.  The easiest way to get the new background
displayed is to use your window manager to either iconify and then
uniconify the window, or to push it behind another window and then pull
it back to the front.  You could also do it by calling
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>win(Window),
          clear_window(Window).</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568)
     </pre>

   <p>Again we need to refresh the window:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>win(Window),
          draw_string(Window, 2, 19, 'Hello, world!!').</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568)
     </pre>

   <p>That doesn't look terribly interesting.  Try drawing the string in white
instead of black.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>win(Window),
          get_screen_attributes([white_pixel(Pix)]),
          put_graphics_attributes(Window, [foreground(Pix)]),
          draw_string(Window, 2, 19, 'Hello, world!!').</kbd>
     
     Window = window(2376568),
     Pix = 0
     </pre>

   <p>The second line determines the pixel value for white on our screen.  X
does not establish a standard pixel value for black and white, so you
must determine it explicitly.  In fact, X doesn't even guarantee that
the <code>black_pixel/1</code> and <code>white_pixel/1</code> attributes will yield
black and white, but they are <dfn>logical</dfn> black and white.

   <p>The third line sets the foreground color, the color to draw in, to
white.  Finally, we draw our message.  The default
drawing color in ProXL is <code>black_pixel</code>; this is why you didn't have to
specify it earlier.  But now that we've specified white, all drawing
will be done in white until we change it again.
