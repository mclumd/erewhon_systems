<h4 class="subsection">Classifying Characters -- <code>library(ctypes)</code></h4>

   <p>One of the problems facing anyone who uses Prolog on more than one system
is that different operating systems use different characters to signal the
end of a line or the end of a file.  We have
<pre class="example">     Dialect         DEC-10 Prolog   SICStus Prolog  Quintus Prolog
     OS              (TOPS-10)       (UNIX,Windows)  (UNIX,Windows)
     
     end-of-line     31 (^_)         10 (LF, ^J)     10 (LF, ^J)
     end-of-file     26 (^Z)         -1              -1
     </pre>

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Windows note:</strong> From an application program's point of view, each line
in the file is terminated with a single &lt;LFD&gt;.  However, what's
actually stored in the file is the sequence &lt;RET&gt;&lt;LFD&gt;. 
</blockquote>

   <p>A prudent Prolog programmer will try to avoid writing these
constants into his program.  Indeed, a prudent Prolog programmer
will try to avoid relying too much on the fact that Prolog uses
the ASCII character set.

   <p>Quintus Prolog addresses these problems by imitating the programming language
C.  The package <code>library(ctypes)</code>
defines predicates that recognize or
enumerate certain types of characters.  Where possible, the names and
the character sets
have been borrowed from C.

   <p>Except as indicated, all of the predicates in <code>library(ctypes)</code> check the
type of a given character,
or backtrack over all the characters of the appropriate type if
given a variable.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>is_endfile(</code><var>-Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
<var>Char</var> is the end-of-file character.  There is only one such character. 
If <code>get0/1</code> returns it,
the end of the input file has been reached, and the file should not be
read further.  No special significance is attached to this
character on output; it might not be a valid output character at all (as
in Quintus Prolog) or it might simply be written out along with other text.

     <p>The need for this predicate is largely obviated by the built-in predicate
<code>at_end_of_file/[0,1]</code> in Release 3.

     <br><dt><code>is_newline(</code><var>-Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
<var>Char</var> is the end-of-line character.  There is only one such character. 
You can rely on it not being space, tab, or any printing character. 
It is returned by <code>get0/1</code> at the end of an input line. 
The end-of-line character is a valid output character, and when
written to a file ends the current output line.  It should not be used to
<em>start</em> lines, only to <em>end</em> them.

     <p>The need for this predicate is largely obviated by the built-in predicate
<code>skip_line/[0,1]</code> in Release 3.

     <br><dt><code>is_newpage(</code><var>-Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
<var>Char</var> is the end-of-page character.  There is at most one such character,
and when it is defined at all it is the ASCII "formfeed" character.  On
some systems there may be no end-of-page character.  This character
is returned
by <code>get0/1</code> at the end of an input page.  It is a valid output
character,
and when written to a file ends the current output page.  It should not be
used to <em>start</em> pages, only to <em>end</em> them.

     <br><dt><code>is_endline(</code><var>+Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>Some systems permit more than one end-of-line character for terminal
input; one of them is always C's "newline" character, another is the
end-of-file character (<kbd>^D</kbd> or <kbd>^Z</kbd>) if typed anywhere but as the first
character of a line, and the last is the "eol" character, which the user
can set with the <code>stty(1)</code> command.

     <p><code>is_endline/1</code> accepts most ASCII control characters, but not space, tab,
or delete, which covers all the line terminators likely to arise in
practice.  It should only be used to recognize line terminators; if
passed a variable, it will raise an error exception.

     <p>The need for this predicate is largely obviated by the built-in predicate
<code>at_end_of_line/[0,1]</code> in Release 3.

     <br><dt><code>is_alnum(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is true when <var>Char</var> is the ASCII code of a letter or digit.  It may be used
to recognize alphanumerics or to enumerate them.  Underscore <code>_</code> is
<em>not</em> an alphanumeric character.  (See <code>is_csym/1</code> below.)

     <br><dt><code>is_alpha(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the ASCII code of a letter. 
It may be used to
recognize letters or to enumerate them.  Underscore <code>_</code> is <em>not</em>
a letter.  (See <code>is_csymf/1</code> below.)

     <br><dt><code>is_ascii(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is in the range 0..127. 
If <var>Char</var> is a variable, <code>is_ascii/1</code>
(like most of the predicates in this section) will try to bind it to
each of the acceptable values in turn (that is, it will enumerate them). 
Whether the end-of-file character satisfies <code>is_ascii/1</code> or not is
system-dependent.

     <br><dt><code>is_char(?Char)</code>
     <dd>is true when Char is a character code in whatever the
range happens to be.  (In this version: ISO 8859/1.)

     <br><dt><code>is_cntrl(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is an ASCII control character;
that is, when <var>Char</var>
is the code for DEL (127) or else is in the range 0..31. 
Space is <em>not</em> a control character.

     <br><dt><code>is_csym(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a character that
can appear in an
identifier.  C identifiers are identical to Prolog identifiers that start
with a letter.  Put another way, <var>Char</var> is a letter, digit, or underscore. 
There are C compilers that allow other characters in identifiers, such
as <code>$</code>.  In such a system, C's version of <code>iscsym/1</code> will accept those
additional characters, but Prolog's will not.

     <br><dt><code>is_csymf(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a character
that can appear as the first
character of a C or Prolog identifier.  Put another way, <var>Char</var> is a letter
or an underscore.

     <br><dt><code>is_digit(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a decimal digit;
that is, a character in the range 0..9.

     <br><dt><code>is_digit(</code><var>?Char</var><code>, </code><var>?Weight</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the
character code of a decimal digit, and <var>Weight</var> is its decimal
value.

     <br><dt><code>is_digit(</code><var>?Char</var><code>, </code><var>?Base</var><code>, </code><var>?Weight</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a digit in the given <var>Base</var>. 
<var>Base</var>
should be an integer in the range 2..36.  The digits (that is, the possible
values of <var>Char</var>) are 0..9, A..Z, and
a..z, where the case of a letter is ignored.  <var>Weight</var> is the value of
<var>Char</var> considered as a digit in that base, given as a decimal number. 
For example,
     <pre class="example">          is_digit(97 /* a */, 16, 10)
          is_digit(52 /* 4 */, 10,  4)
          is_digit(70 /* F */, 16, 15)
          </pre>

     <p>This is a genuine relation; it may be used all possible ways.  You can
even use it to enumerate all the triples that satisfy the relation.  Each
argument must be either a variable or an integer.

     <br><dt><code>is_graph(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a "graphic"
character, that is, for any
printing character other than space.  The graphic characters are the
letters and digits, plus
     <pre class="example">          !  "  #  $  %  &amp;  '  (  )  *  ;  &lt;  =  &gt;  ?  @
          [  \  ]  ^  _  `  {  |  }  ~  +  ,  -  .  /  :
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>is_lower(</code><var>+Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a lowercase
letter, a..z.

     <br><dt><code>is_paren(</code><var>?Left</var><code>, </code><var>?Right</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is true when <var>Left</var> and <var>Right</var> together form one of the delimiter pairs
<code>(</code> and <code>)</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>]</code>, or <code>{</code> and <code>}</code>.

     <br><dt><code>is_period(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
<code>is_period/1</code> recognizes each of the three punctuation marks that
can end an English sentence.  That is, <code>is_period(</code><var>Char</var><code>)</code> is true when
<var>Char</var> is an exclamation point (<code>!</code>), a question mark (<code>?</code>), or a
period (<code>.</code>).  Note that if you want to test specifically for a period
character, you should use the goal
     <pre class="example">          Char is "."
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>is_print(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is any of the
ASCII "printing" characters, that is, anything
except a control character.  All the "graphic" characters are "printing"
characters, and so is the space character. 
When written to ordinary terminals, each
printing character takes exactly one column, and Prolog code for lining up
output in nice columns is entitled to rely on this.  The width of a tab, and
the depiction of other control characters than tab or newline, is not
defined.

     <br><dt><code>is_punct(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a non-alphanumeric
printing character;
that is, <var>Char</var> is a space or one of the characters listed explicitly under
<code>is_graph/1</code>.  Note that underscore is a "punct" and so is the space character. 
The reason for this is that C defines it that way, and this package
eschews innovation for innovation's sake.

     <br><dt><code>is_quote(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is one of the quotation
marks <code>`</code> (back-quote), <code>'</code> (single-quote), or <code>"</code> (double-quote).

     <br><dt><code>is_space(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for a white space
character.  This includes
tab (9, ^I), linefeed (10, ^J), vertical tab (11, ^K), formfeed
(12, ^L), carriage return (13, ^M), and space (32).  These constitute the C
definition of white space. 
For compatibility with DEC-10 Prolog, <code>is_space/1</code> also accepts
the (31, ^_) character.

     <br><dt><code>is_upper(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is the code for an uppercase
letter, A..Z.

     <br><dt><code>is_white(</code><var>?Char</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>is true when <var>Char</var> is a space or a tab.  The reason
for distinguishing
between this and <code>is_space/1</code> is that if you skip over characters satisfying
<code>is_space/1</code> you will also be skipping over the ends of lines and pages
(though at least you will not run off the end of the file), while if you
skip over characters satisfying <code>is_white/1</code> you will stop at the
end of the current line.

     <br><dt><code>to_lower(</code><var>?Char</var><code>, </code><var>?Lower</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is true when <var>Char</var> is any ASCII character code, and <var>Lower</var> is the
lowercase equivalent of <var>Char</var>.  The lowercase equivalent of an uppercase
letter is the corresponding lowercase letter.  The lowercase
equivalent of any other character is the same character.  If you have
a string (list of character codes) <var>X</var>, you can obtain a version of <var>X</var>
with uppercase letters mapped to lowercase letters and other characters
left alone by calling the library routine
     <pre class="example">          maplist(to_lower, X, LowerCasedX)
          </pre>

     <p>In normal use of <code>to_lower/2</code>, <var>Char</var> is bound.  If <var>Char</var> is
uninstantiated, <code>to_lower/2</code>
will still work correctly, but will be less efficient.  If you
want to convert a lowercase letter <var>Kl</var> to its uppercase version <var>Ku</var>,
<em>do not</em> use <code>to_lower/2</code>; <code>to_lower(Ku, 97)</code> has two solutions:
65 (A) and 97 (a).  Use <code>to_upper/2</code> instead.

     <br><dt><code>to_upper(</code><var>?Char</var><code>, </code><var>?Upper</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is true when <var>Char</var> is any ASCII character code, and <var>Upper</var> is the
uppercase equivalent of <var>Char</var>.  The uppercase equivalent of a lowercase
letter is the corresponding uppercase letter.  The uppercase
equivalent of any other character is the same character.  If you
have a string (list of character codes) <var>X</var>, you can obtain a version of
<var>X</var> with lowercase letters mapped to uppercase and other characters
left alone by calling the library routine
     <pre class="example">          maplist(X, to_upper, UpperCasedX)
          </pre>

   </dl>

   <p>The System V macro <code>isxdigit()</code> is not represented in this package because
<code>isdigit/3</code> subsumes it.  The System V macros <code>_tolower()</code> and <code>_toupper()</code> are
not represented because <code>to_lower/2</code> and <code>to_upper/2</code> subsume them.

   <p>The predicates needed for portability between operating systems are

     <ul>

     <li><code>is_endfile/1</code>
<li><code>is_endline/1</code>
<li><code>is_newline/1</code>
<li><code>is_newpage/1</code>
</ul>

   <p>Remember:  <code>is_endfile/1</code> and <code>is_endline/1</code> are for recognizing the end of an
input file or the end of an input line, while <code>is_newline/1</code> and <code>is_newpage/1</code>
return the character that you should
give to <code>put/1</code> to end a line or page of output.
