<h5 class="subsubsection"><code>create_servant(</code><var>+Machine, +SavedState, +OutFile</var><code>)</code></h5>

   <p>Before a master can use a servant, the servant must first be started up
and connections to it must be made.  This is done by a call to
<code>create_servant/[2,3]</code>.

   <p><var>Machine</var> is the name of the machine on which to run the servant. 
If <var>Machine</var> is omitted, or set to the null atom <code>''</code>, the
servant is run on the same machine, and communication is via pipes. 
If <var>Machine</var> is the atom <code>local</code>, the servant is run on the
same machine but communication is via sockets.  If <var>Machine</var> names
another machine, communication will be via sockets.  You need to be
able to use <code>rsh</code> on that machine.

   <p><var>SavedState</var> is the name of the file that contains the Prolog saved state
on that machine.  It must have been previously created with <code>save_servant/1</code>.

   <p><var>OutFile</var> is the name of the file to which output from the servant will be
written.  This file is on the local machine and it will be created if it does
not already exist.  <em>This file should be examined if there are problems with
the communication to the servant.</em>  Tracing information (if any, see
<a href="ipc-rpc-tra.html#ipc-rpc-tra">ipc-rpc-tra</a>) will also be written to this file.

   <p>If <var>OutFile</var> is the atom <code>user</code>, then all
output will be sent to the standard output stream of the master. 
If it is the null atom <code>''</code>, the servant's standard output is discarded and its
standard error is directed to the master's standard error.
