<h4 class="subsection">Overview of QOF Files</h4>

   <p>Quintus Prolog release 3 provides a much more powerful
alternative to the traditional save/restore facilities of Prolog.  It
is now possible to save, and subsequently load, individual predicates,
or sets of predicates, or entire modules of predicates, or indeed the
complete Prolog database.  Such sets of predicates are saved into
Quintus' standard <dfn>Quintus Object Format</dfn> ("QOF" files). 
This significantly extends the utility of QOF files, which were
previously only used to produce runtime systems and stand-alone
programs.  <dfn>QOF files</dfn> are now a fully general way of storing
arbitrary Prolog facts and rules in a form that can be quickly and
easily used.  QOF files contain a machine independent representation
of both compiled and dynamic Prolog predicates.  This means they are
completely portable between different platforms running Quintus
Prolog.

   <p>QOF files can be generated by:

     <ul>

     <li>saving a selected set of predicates from a running Prolog application
(see <a href="ref-sls.html#ref-sls">ref-sls</a>);
<li>using the stand-alone <code>qpc</code> Prolog compiler to compile
individual Prolog source files (see <a href="sap-srs-qpc.html#sap-srs-qpc">sap-srs-qpc</a>).

   </ul>

   <p>QOF files can be used by:

     <ul>

     <li>loading them into a running Prolog application (see <a href="ref-sls.html#ref-sls">ref-sls</a>);
<li>linking them together, using the stand-alone <code>qld</code> linker,
into an object file
for linking into an executable with static Prolog code made
shareable (see <a href="sap-srs-qld.html#sap-srs-qld">sap-srs-qld</a>). This executable can either:

          <ul>

          <li>be a full Quintus Prolog Development System allowing continued development;
<li>or can be a runtime system for deployment of the application. 
</ul>

   </ul>

   <p>QOF saving and loading is available in both Quintus Prolog development
systems and runtime systems built for distribution.  In a development
system, code can be incrementally compiled using the built-in compiler
and then saved into a QOF file.  In a runtime system, which does not
include the built-in compiler, dynamic code can be asserted and then
saved. Runtime systems can load QOF files containing previously
compiled code.

   <p>This combination of the capabilities of the Quintus Prolog Runtime
Generator, with the saving and loading facilities of Quintus Prolog
release 3, and the cross-platform portability of QOF files,
provides tremendous flexibility that can be used for many purposes. 
For example:

     <ul>

     <li>precompiling Prolog libraries for fast loading;
<li>packaging Prolog code for distribution;
<li>generating precompiled databases of application data;
<li>selectively loading particular application databases (and rule bases);
<li>saving Prolog data across application runs;
<li>building and saving new application databases from within applications;
<li>linking selected application databases into the application executable
for ease of distribution, or to get code sharing and better memory and
paging performance. 
</ul>

   <p>The facilities for saving and loading QOF files are more than just
a convenience when developing programs; they are also a powerful
tool that can be used as part of the application itself.
