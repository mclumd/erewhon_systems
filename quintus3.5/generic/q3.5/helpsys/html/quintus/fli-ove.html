<h3 class="section">Overview</h3>

   <p>The <dfn>Foreign Language Interface</dfn> is the protocol by which you can
call functions written in other programming languages from Prolog (see
<a href="fli-p2f.html#fli-p2f">fli-p2f</a>), and by which you can call Prolog predicates from C (see
<a href="fli-ffp.html#fli-ffp">fli-ffp</a>).

   <p>In both cases you have to supply declarations in Prolog specifying the
argument types of the function/predicate being called.  This is
necessary so that the Prolog system can automatically make the necessary
transformations of data as they are passed between the languages.  The
declarations are compiled into special abstract machine instructions in
order to minimize the cost of inter-language calls.

   <p>It is possible to specify that an argument is a Prolog term.  In this
case a foreign function receiving such a term sees it as a special kind
of object called a <dfn>QP_term_ref</dfn>.  A set of functions is provided that
allow foreign functions to manipulate terms via these QP_term_refs.  Term
passing is described in <a href="fli-p2f-trm.html#fli-p2f-trm">fli-p2f-trm</a> and <a href="fli-ffp-a2s-trm.html#fli-ffp-a2s-trm">fli-ffp-a2s-trm</a>. 
The functions for manipulating terms are described in <a href="cfu.html#cfu">cfu</a>.

   <p>Some kinds of data are not best represented in Prolog.  It is better to
keep such data in foreign data structures and just pass pointers to these
structures to Prolog.  Given such pointers, Prolog arithmetic
predicates such as <code>is/2</code> and <code>=:=/2</code> allow access to foreign
data; see <a href="ref-ari-aex.html#ref-ari-aex">ref-ari-aex</a>.  Foreign data can also be
modified directly from Prolog using <code>assign/2</code>, which is described in
<a href="cfu.html#cfu">cfu</a>.

   <p>Input/Output operations on Prolog streams can be performed in C. 
Functions, macros and variables for this purpose are summarized in
<a href="fli-ios-bio.html#fli-ios-bio">fli-ios-bio</a>.  The I/O system has been designed to make it
maximally customizable at the C level.  The kinds of customization that you
might want to do are to create a stream to read from or write
to a socket, or to create a stream to read from an encrypted file. 
The C level of the I/O system is described in <a href="fli-ios.html#fli-ios">fli-ios</a>.

   <p>A number of functions are defined to aid in embedding Prolog programs
into other software systems.  These functions all begin with the letters
<code>QU</code> and they are defined in <a href="fli-emb.html#fli-emb">fli-emb</a>.  The source of these
functions is provided with the system, and you may define your own versions
to replace them.  To do this you will need to link your routines with
the development system to make your own customized version of the development
system.  How to do this is described in <a href="sap.html#sap">sap</a>.
