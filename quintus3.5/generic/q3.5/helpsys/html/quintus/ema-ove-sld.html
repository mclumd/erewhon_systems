<h4 class="subsection">The Source Linked Debugger</h4>

   <p>The Emacs-based source linked debugger for Quintus Prolog works very
much like the QUI debugger (see <a href="dbg-sld.html#dbg-sld">dbg-sld</a>), with
a few significant differences.  This document describes the
differences.

   <p>In order to enable the Emacs-based debugger, execute the Emacs command
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; x enable-prolog-source-debugger</kbd>; to disable it, type <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt;
x disable-prolog-source-debugger</kbd>.  If you would like always to use
the source-linked debugger when debugging Quintus Prolog code under
Emacs, put the following in your <code>.emacs</code> file:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'comint-prolog-hook 'enable-prolog-source-debugger)
     </pre>

   <p>Alternatively, under Prolog you may load
<code>library(emacsdebug)</code> and then execute the Prolog
goal <code>emacs_debugger(_,on)</code> to enable source-linked debugging,
<code>emacs_debugger(_,off)</code> to disable it, and
<code>emacs_debugger(</code><var>State</var><code>,</code><var>State</var><code>)</code>, to see whether it is enabled
or not (<var>State</var> will be bound to <code>on</code> if enabled and <code>off</code> if
disabled).

   <p>The first obvious difference when running the Emacs-based debugger
compared to the QUI one is that it doesn't have any buttons or menu to
control it.  Therefore all commands are keyboard-based.  Where
possible, the commands are the same as those used in the standard
debugger, so most of them should be easy to remember.  The most
important command in the Emacs-based debugger, as in the standard
debugger is the <b>help</b> command, invoked by a single <kbd>h</kbd> or <kbd>?</kbd>
character.  This command displays the following summary:

<pre class="example">       c  creep         &lt;RET&gt; creep            &lt;SPC&gt; creep
       l  leap           +  spy goal/pred     b  break
       s  skip           -  nospy goal/pred   a  abort
       z  zip            [  frame up          ?  help
       n  nonstop        ]  frame down        h  help
       q  quasi-skip     |  frame back        =  debugging
       r  retry          f  fail              .  edit definition
       w  open extra window                   x  close extra window
     </pre>

   <p>The commands in the first column behave exactly as they do in the QUI
debugger.  The <b>spy</b> and <b>nospy</b> commands place a spypoint on the current
predicate when at a head port, and on the current goal when at any
other port.  The <b>frame up/down/back</b> commands do exactly what the
corresponding QUI debugger commands do, as do <b>break</b> and <b>abort</b>.  The
<b>debugging</b> command just invokes the standard <code>debugging/0</code> built-in
predicate, showing the current debugging and leashing modes, as well as
listing the currently active spypoints.

   <p>The <b>open/close extra window</b> commands prompt for a single character
to select the "extra" window to display, offering the choices
<code>b=bindings; s=standard; and a=ancestors</code>.  The bindings window is
probably the most useful of the three.

   <p>Finally, the <b>edit definition</b> command opens puts the file being
debugged in an editor buffer, putting point at the location of the
current debugger port (where the arrow is).  You may edit and save the
file, and then recompile it.  It is recommeded that you recompile the
whole file rather than just the part you have changed, because the
debugger keeps track of the times files are written and compiled,
disabling source linking when the file on disk is newer than the code
loaded into Prolog.

   <p>The graphical arrows of the QUI debugger are simulated by a
two-character sequence in the Emacs-based debugger.  The Call, Done
and determinate Head ports are signified by <code>-&gt;</code>.  Exit and
nondeterminate Head ports are signified by <code>=&gt;</code>.  Redo and Fail are
shown as <code>&lt;-</code>.  The Exception port is indicated by <code>&lt;#</code>.  Finally,
where the QUI debugger shows a "hollow" arrow to signify that the
currently shown port is not actually the active port but an ancestor
of it, the Emacs-based debugger shows <code>^&gt;</code>.

   <p>The Emacs-based debugger currently offers no way to change the
leashing; you can do that using the usual Prolog <code>leash/1</code> built-in
predicate.   Similarly, it offers no way to set a spyoint except when
debugging a call to the predicate or goal to be spied.  Again, the
usual <code>spy/1</code> and <code>add_spypoint/1</code> built-in predicates can
accomplish this.  Finally, the Emacs-based debugger offers no direct
way to set the print format.  To change this you must use the
<code>window_format/3</code> command exported from the <code>emacs_debug</code> module:

<pre class="example">     window_format(<var>+Window</var>, <var>-Oldformat</var>, <var>+Newformat</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>Window</var> is one of: <code>source</code>, <code>bindings</code>,
<code>ancestors</code>, or <code>standard</code>, and <var>Newformat</var> is a list of valid
options for the last argument to <code>write_term/[2,3]</code>.  The default
format for all windows is

<pre class="example">     [quoted(true), portrayed(true), max_depth(5)]
     </pre>
