<h5 class="subsubsection">Messages</h5>

   <p>The <code>message/4</code> predicate is used to ask whether a message is
defined for a class or to find what messages are defined for a class,
etc. It does not distinguish between messages whose methods are
defined in the class itself and those that are inherited from a
superclass.

   <p>The <code>direct_message/4</code> predicate is used to ask whether a message is
not only defined for a class, but whether the method for that message
is defined in the class itself. It can also be used to determine
which methods are defined in a class. This ability to look inside a
class definition makes <code>direct_message/4</code> an egregious violator of
the principle of information hiding.  Thus it, like
<code>class_ancestor/2</code>, should mainly be confined to use in programmer
support applications.

   <p>Both <code>message/4</code> and <code>direct_message/4</code> take the message operator
as an argument, along with the class, message name and arity. Hence it
is possible to use these predicates to ask about get, put or send
messages.

   <p>It is not possible to ask about a class's slots, nor should it
be. However, it is possible (and quite reasonable) to ask about the
get and put messages that are defined for a class. For example, the
following goal finds all the 1-argument messages that are defined for
both the get and put message operators in the class <var>Class</var>.

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>setof(Message,
     	   (message(</kbd><var>Class</var><kbd>, &lt;&lt;, Msg, 1),
     	    message(</kbd><var>Class</var><kbd>, &gt;&gt;, Msg, 1)),
     	   L).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>There may or may not be slots corresponding to these messages; that
detail is hidden in the definition of <var>Class</var>. However, it should be
possible to use <var>Class</var> as if the slots were there.

   <p>As an example, recall the polar coordinate interface to the point
class, which defined get and put methods for <code>r</code> and <code>theta</code>, even
though data was represented inside an object by rectangular
coordinates <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>.
