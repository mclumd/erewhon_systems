<h5 class="subsubsection">Prolog Output and Input</h5>

   <p>The output from Prolog (both <code>stdout</code> and <code>stderr</code>) is
redirected to this window.  As output is being redirected
to this window, the window is scrolled so that the
insertion point is always visible.

   <p>Input to Prolog is also received from this window.  When
Prolog is expecting to receive a term (which also includes
a query), the term will not be transmitted to Prolog until
its full-stop is followed by a newline.  This allows you to
edit previously typed lines in a multi-line term before
transmitting those lines to Prolog.  When Prolog is
expecting to receive input that is not a term, a newline
will immediately transmit the line just typed.

   <p>The text that appears before the current prompt is not
editable.  You cannot type characters into this window
while output is also being redirected into it.
