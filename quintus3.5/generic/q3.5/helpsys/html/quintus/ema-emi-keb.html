<h4 class="subsection">Rebinding Keys in Your Initialization File</h4>

   <p>You can customize GNU Emacs by defining key bindings and/or Emacs-Lisp
functions in a special GNU Emacs initialization file called <code>.emacs</code>,
which must be kept in your home directory. 
To locate it, do <kbd>^x ^f</kbd> and type <code>~/.emacs</code> as the
filename. (Windows users: the <code>~</code> character is a abbreviation,
inherited from UNIX, for your home directory.)

   <p>When GNU Emacs is started, it loads your GNU Emacs initialization
file, if you have one, before loading the Emacs-Lisp files defining the
editor interface.  This means that any key bindings that you make in
this file may be overridden by the editor interface package.  However,
you can tailor the interface, if you wish, by defining one or both of
the following "hook functions":
     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>prolog-startup-hook</code>
     <dd>If a function by this name is defined, it will be
called after all the initializations done on invoking Prolog through the
editor interface are completed, and before the screen is displayed.

     <br><dt><code>prolog-mode-hook</code>
     <dd>If a function by this name is defined, it will be called
every time Prolog mode is entered.  Prolog mode is entered every time you
edit a file with a <code>.pl</code> extension, and can also be entered by using the
command <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; x prolog-mode</kbd>. 
</dl>

   <p>For example, if you don't like incremental search, and you prefer to
use <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; e</kbd> for moving to the end of a sentence, rather than for
enlarging the current window, then you should add the following
function definition to your initialization file:
<pre class="example">     (defun
          prolog-startup-hook ()
             (global-set-key  "\C-s" 'search-forward)
             (global-set-key  "\C-r" 'search-reverse)
             (global-set-key  "\ee"  'forward-sentence)
             (global-set-key  "\e\e"
                              'enlarge-window))
     </pre>

   <p>Note that the command strings could be written as : <code>"\C-s"</code> (Backslash
<code>C-s</code>) for example.  This version of <code>prolog-startup-hook</code> also binds
the useful <code>enlarge-window</code> command, which is normally on
<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; e</kbd> in this interface, to <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; &lt;ESC&gt;</kbd>.

   <p>If you wish to change key bindings in Prolog mode, you should use
<code>local-set-key</code> rather than <code>global-set-key</code>, because the effect of Prolog
mode is local to a particular window.  For example, if you don't like the
way &lt;LFD&gt; works in Prolog mode, you can define
<pre class="example">     (defun
          prolog-mode-hook ()
             (local-set-key  "\C-j" 'newline-and-indent))
     </pre>

   <p>This restores the default binding of &lt;LFD&gt;.
