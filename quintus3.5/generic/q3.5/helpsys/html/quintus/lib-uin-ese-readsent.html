<h5 class="subsubsection"><code>library(readsent)</code></h5>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>read_until(</code><var>?Delimiters</var><code>, </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>reads characters from the
current input until a character in the <var>Delimiters</var> string is read.  The
characters are accumulated in the <var>Answer</var> string, and include the
closing delimiter.  The end-of-file character always acts as a
delimiter, even if it is not in the list of characters you supply.

     <br><dt><code>trim_blanks(</code><var>+RawInput</var><code>, </code><var>?Cleaned</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>removes leading and trailing
layout characters from <var>RawInput</var>, and replaces internal groups of
layout characters by single spaces.

     <br><dt><code>chars_to_words(+Chars, ?Words)</code>
     <dd>parses a list of characters (read by read_until) into a list of tokens, where a token is
          <dl>

          <br><dt><var>X</var>
          <dd><var>X</var> a full stop or other punctuation mark

          <br><dt><code>atom(</code><var>X</var><code>)</code>
          <dd><var>X</var> a sequence of letters, e.g. <code>atom(the)</code>

          <br><dt><code>integer(</code><var>X</var><code>)</code>
          <dd><var>X</var> a sequence of digits, e.g. <code>integer(12)</code>

          <br><dt><code>apost</code>
          <dd><code>'</code>

          <br><dt><code>aposts</code>
          <dd><code>'</code>s

          <br><dt><code>string(</code><var>X</var><code>)</code>
          <dd><var>X</var> <code>"</code><var>..sequence of any..</var><code>"</code>
</dl>

     <p>Thus the string <code>the "Z-80" is on card 12.</code> would be parsed as
<code>[atom(the),string('Z-80'),atom(is),atom(on),atom(card), integer(12),'.']</code>. 
It is up to the sentence parser to decide what to
do with these.  Note that the final full stop, if any, is retained,
as the parser may need it.

     <br><dt><code>case_shift(</code><var>+Mixed</var><code>, </code><var>?Lower</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>converts all the upper case letters in
<var>Mixed</var> to lower case.  Other characters (not necessarily letters!) are
left alone.  If you decide to accept other characters in words only
<code>chars_to_atom</code> has to alter.  See also <code>lower/2</code> in <code>library(caseconv)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>read_line(-Chars)</code>
     <dd>reads characters up to the next newline or the
end of the file, and returns them in a list, including the newline or
end-of-file.  Usually you want multiple spaces conflated to one, and
the newline dropped.  To do this, call <code>trim_blanks</code> on the result.  For
a routine that does not include the newline character in the result,
see the predicate <code>get_line/1</code> in <code>library(lineio)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>read_sent(</code><var>-Sentence</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
reads a single sentence from the current input stream.  It reads
characters up to the first sentence terminator (as defined by <code>is_period/1</code>)
it finds, then throws characters
away until it has reached the end of a line.  The characters read are then
broken up into "words", where a "word" is
          <ul>

          <li>a sequence of letters, which is converted to lowercase and returned
as a compound term <code>atom(</code><var>Word</var><code>)</code>.  For example, <code>THIS</code> would be returned
as <code>atom(this)</code>
<li>a sequence of decimal digits, which is returned as a compound term
<code>integer(</code><var>Value</var><code>)</code>.  For example, <code>0123</code> would be returned as <code>integer(123)</code>. 
Plus and minus signs become separate atoms. 
<li>a sequence of characters in double quotes, which is returned as a
compound term <code>string(</code><var>X</var><code>)</code>, where <var>X</var> is an atom containing the characters
between the quotes.  Two adjacent quotes are read as one, so the input string
<code>Double "" Quote</code> is returned as <code>string('Double " Quote')</code>. 
<li>apostrophe s (<code>'s</code>) is returned as the atom <code>aposts</code>. 
<li>apostrophe not followed by s (<code>'</code>) is returned as the atom <code>apost</code>. 
<li>any other graphic character is returned as a single-character Prolog atom. 
</ul>

     <p>The resulting string is returned in <var>Sentence</var>. 
Here is an example.
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>read_sent(X).</kbd>
          |: <kbd>The predicate read_sent/1 accepts sentences</kbd>
          |: <kbd>that span more than 1 line, but not lines</kbd>
          |: <kbd>that contain +2 or more sentences.  trash trash</kbd>
          
          X = [atom(the),atom(predicate),string(read_sent),
               atom(accepts),atom(sentences),atom(that),
               atom(span),atom(more),atom(than),integer(1),
               atom(line),',',atom(but),atom(not),atom(lines),
               atom(that),atom(contain),+,integer(2),atom(or),
               atom(more),atom(sentences),.]
          </pre>

     <p>This is more unwieldy than the output of <code>read_in/1</code>, but it does mean that
your parser can tell the difference between words, numbers, and strings
by pattern matching rather than having to use the <dfn>meta-logical</dfn>
predicates <code>atom/1</code>, <code>integer/1</code>, and so forth.
