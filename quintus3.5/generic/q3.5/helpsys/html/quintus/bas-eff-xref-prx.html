   <p>Your code will probably rely on operator declarations and
possibly term expansion. The cross-referencer handles this in
much the same way as <code>qpc(1)</code>: you must supply an
initialization file, using the <code>-i </code><var>ifile</var><code></code> option.

   <p>Supply meta-predicate declarations for your
meta-predicates.  Otherwise, the cross-referencer will not follow
the meta-predicates' arguments.  Be sure the
cross-referencer encounters the meta-predicate declarations
<em>before</em> it encounters calls to the declared predicates.

   <p>The cross-referencer traces from initializations, hooks,
predicates declared <code>public</code>, and optionally from
<code>user:runtime_entry/1</code> and module declarations.  The
way it handles meta-predicates requires that your application
load its module-files before its non-module-files.

   <p>This cross-referencer was written in order to tear out the copious dead
code from the application that the author became responsible for. If you
are doing such a thing, the cross-referencer is an invaluable tool. Be
sure to save the output from the first run that you get from the cross
referencer: this is very useful resource to help you find things that
you've accidentally ripped out and that you really needed after all.

   <p>There are situations where the cross-referencer does not follow certain
predicates. This can happen if the predicate name is
constructed on the fly, or if it is retrieved from the
database. In this case, add <code>public</code> declarations for
these.  Alternatively, you could create term expansions that are
peculiar to the cross-referencer.
