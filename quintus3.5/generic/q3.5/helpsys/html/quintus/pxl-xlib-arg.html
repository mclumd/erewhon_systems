<h4 class="subsection">Arguments</h4>

   <p>Arguments and argument order to ProXL primitives are not always directly
predictable from their Xlib counterparts, but some rules of thumb can
be helpful:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Almost all Xlib functions take a display as first argument.  ProXL doesn't
need this argument at all if any X resource (i.e., a server-side
resource, like a window or GC or font) appears in the call.  So few ProXL
primitives take a display argument. 
<li>All the ProXL primitives that DO require a display have a version that
allows the display to be defaulted.  Also, several ProXL primitives
require a screen as argument, and these, too, allow that argument to be
defaulted.  See the section on the default screen below for details. 
<li>Several Xlib functions take a window as argument (or some other X
resource) when all they really want to know is a screen.  In these
cases, the analogous ProXL primitive takes a screen as argument.  Note
that rule 2 above applies in these cases.
        </ol>

   <p>ProXL doesn't always use the same argument order as Xlib.  There are a
few reasons for different argument order.  Firstly, ProXL has defaults
for some arguments, so sometimes argument orders are changed to
facilitate defaults.  ProXL also rearranges arguments to make parallels
among families of procedures more obvious.  In most cases, however, the
argument order for ProXL procedures is the same as their Xlib
counterparts.
