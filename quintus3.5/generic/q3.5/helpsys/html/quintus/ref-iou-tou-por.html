<h5 class="subsubsection">Using the <code>portray</code> hook</h5>

   <p><code>print/1</code> is called from within the system in two places:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>to print the bindings of variables after a question has succeeded
<li>to print a goal during debugging
        </ol>

   <p>By default, the effect of <code>print/1</code> is the same as that of
<code>write/1</code>, but you can change its effect
by providing clauses for the hook predicate <code>portray/1</code>.

   <p>If <var>X</var> is a variable, then it is printed using <code>write(</code><var>X</var><code>)</code>. 
Otherwise the user-definable procedure <code>portray(</code><var>X</var><code>)</code> is called. 
If this succeeds, then it is assumed
that <var>X</var> has been printed and <code>print/1</code> exits (succeeds). 
Note that <code>print/1</code> always calls <code>portray/1</code> in module
<code>user</code>. 
Therefore, to be visible to <code>print/1</code>, <code>portray/1</code> must
either be defined in or imported into module <code>user</code>.

   <p>If the call to <code>portray/1</code> fails, and if <var>X</var> is a compound term, then
<code>write/1</code> is used to write the principal functor of <var>X</var> and
<code>print/1</code> is called recursively on its arguments.  If <var>X</var>
is atomic, it is written using <code>write/1</code>.

   <p>When <code>print/1</code> has to print a list, say <code>[X1,X2,...,Xn]</code>, it passes
the whole list to <code>portray/1</code>.  As usual, if <code>portray/1</code> succeeds,
it is assumed to have printed the entire list, and <code>print/1</code> does
nothing further with this term.  Otherwise <code>print/1</code> writes the
list using bracket notation, calling <code>print/1</code> on each element of the
list in turn.

   <p>Since <code>[X1,X2,...,Xn]</code> is simply a different way of
writing <code>.(X1,[X2,...,Xn])</code>, one might expect <code>print/1</code> to be called
recursively on the two arguments <code>X1</code> and <code>[X2,...,Xn]</code>, giving <code>portray/1</code>
a second
chance at <code>[X2,...,Xn]</code>.  This does <em>not</em> happen; lists are a
special case in which <code>print/1</code> is called separately for each of
<code>X1,X2,...Xn</code>.

   <p>If you would like lists of character codes printed
        by <code>print/1</code> using double-quote notation, you should
        include <code>library(printchars)</code> (described in  <a href="lib.html#lib">lib</a>)
 as part of your version
        of <code>portray/1</code>.

   <p>Often it is desirable to define clauses for <code>portray/1</code> in different files. 
This can be achieved either by declaring it multifile in each of the files, or
by using <code>library(addportray)</code>.
