<h4 class="subheading">Description</h4>

   <p><code>extern/1</code> is used to make Prolog predicates callable from
functions written in other languages.  <code>extern/1</code> must appear as a
compile-time declaration; furthermore, it may not appear in files
loaded into runtime systems.  The user has to declare as callable each
Prolog predicate that is to be called from foreign functions.  Any
Prolog predicate can be declared to be callable from foreign
functions, including system built-ins and predicates that do not
currently have definitions.  Predicates must be declared callable
before they can actually be called from a function written in a
foreign language.

   <p>Arguments are passed to the foreign interface as specified in
<var>ExternSpec</var>:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>+</code>
     <dd>indicates that an argument is to be passed to Prolog from a foreign function.

     <br><dt><code>-</code>
     <dd>indicates that an argument is to be passed from Prolog to the foreign
function. 
</dl>

   <p>Unlike the interface enabling Prolog to call functions written in other
languages, when foreign functions call Prolog there are no return
values or corresponding designators in <var>ExternSpec</var>.

   <p>When a Prolog predicate is declared to be callable, an interface predicate
is created in the current module.  The arity of the interface predicate
is the same as that of the Prolog predicate.  The
name of the interface predicate is that of the Prolog predicate with an
underscore prepended.  The interface predicate is made available to the
user as a hook to the "callability" of the Prolog predicate; for instance,
the callability of the predicate can be saved by putting the interface
predicate in a QOF file via <code>save_predicates/2</code>, then reloaded like
any other predicate.  The interface predicate can also be abolished
like any other predicate; this also has the effect of making the
previously callable Prolog predicate no longer available to foreign
functions.  A call to any interface predicate simply fails.

   <p>For more details about passing arguments from the foreign interface, see
the chapter on the foreign language interface.

<h4 class="subheading">Exceptions</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>instantiation_error</code>
     <dd>
    <var>ExternSpec</var> is uninstantiated

     <p>Some <var>Argspec</var> in <var>ExternSpec</var> is uninstantiated
or is a term that is insufficiently instantiated

     <br><dt><code>type_error</code>
     <dd>
    <var>ExternSpec</var> is instantiated but is not a callable term

     <p>Some <var>Argspec</var> in <var>ExternSpec</var> is not a callable term

     <br><dt><code>domain_error</code>
     <dd>
    Some <var>Argspec</var> in <var>ExternSpec</var> is not one of the forms listed above
</dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Examples</h4>

   <p>It can be quite useful to make the system built-in
<code>call/1</code> available
to foreign functions.  Combined with term manipulation in C, doing so
provides an evaluator for arbitrary Prolog queries.  This can be done
by loading a Prolog file containing the declaration

<pre class="example">     :- extern(call(+term)).
     </pre>

   <p>Prolog's <code>call/1</code> is then available to C via a function like

<pre class="example">     call_prolog(term)
     QP_term_ref term;
     {
         QP_pred_ref call;
         call = QP_predicate("call",1,"user");
         QP_query(call, term);
     }
     </pre>

   <p>For the sake of brevity, this example does not check return values for
failure or errors.  Doing so is generally recommended.  Of course, as
is the case in Prolog, it is faster to call a Prolog predicate directly.
