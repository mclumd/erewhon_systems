<h4 class="subsection">Windows</h4>

   <p>A <dfn>window</dfn> is a rectangular area of the screen.  X supports nested
windows, where child windows are only visible insofar as they are
within the boundary of their parent.  Every application window has a
<dfn>parent window</dfn>, which the window is physically inside.  Every
screen has a single <dfn>root window</dfn>, which is the entire contents of
the screen.  The root window does not have a parent, of course.  A
window's descendents are called its <dfn>inferiors</dfn>.  All drawing into a
window is confined, or <dfn>clipped</dfn>, to the window's boundaries,
including all drawing into the window's inferiors.  Sibling windows
can overlap, in which case the <dfn>stacking order</dfn> of the windows
becomes important, as one window can cover, or <dfn>occlude</dfn>, all or
part of another.  Drawing into a window will not affect parts of the
window that are occluded.

   <p>A window can be <dfn>mapped</dfn>, that is, put on the screen, or not.  If a
window is not mapped, it cannot be seen, nor can any of its inferiors,
whether or not they are mapped.  This means that a window can be
created once, and then mapped and unmapped at will without having to
destroy and later recreate it.  A window is said to be <dfn>viewable</dfn> if
all of its ancestors are mapped.  A window is said to be <dfn>visible</dfn>
if it is viewable, and furthermore, it is not occluded by any
siblings.

   <p>The window manager is distinct from the X server.  In X, the user (by
using a window manager) almost always has control over where and how
large top level windows appear on the screen.  Windows nested within top
level windows, on the other hand, are completely under program
control.  The window manager, in fact, is simply another X program
running alongside your applications.  This means that the user can
change the look and feel of the windows at any time by changing to
another window manager.
