<h4 class="subsection">Exceptions and Critical Regions</h4>

   <p>The point of critical regions in your code is that sometimes you have data-base
updates or other operations that, once started, must be completed in order to
avoid an inconsistent state.  In particular, such operations should not be
interrupted by a <kbd>^C</kbd> from the keyboard.

   <p>In releases of Quintus Prolog prior to release 3.0, <code>library(critical)</code> was
provided to allow critical regions to be specified using the predicates
<code>begin_critical/0</code> and <code>end_critical/0</code>.  These predicates are still
provided, but they should be regarded as obsolete since they do not interact
well with exception handling.  An exception occurring in between the
<code>begin_critical</code> and the <code>end_critical</code> could cause two problems:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>the
Prolog database could be left in an inconsistent state, and
<li>the critical region would never be exited, so interrupts would be left
disabled indefinitely.
        </ol>

   <p>To avoid these problems, you should use the new predicates
<pre class="example">     critical(<var>Goal</var>)
     critical_on_exception(<var>ErrorCode, Goal, Handler</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>which <code>library(critical)</code> now provides.

   <p><code>critical/1</code> runs the specified goal inside a critical region.  It
solves (2)  by catching any exceptions that are
raised and taking care to close the critical region before re-raising the
exception.

   <p><code>critical_on_exception/3</code> allows you to solve
(1) by specifying appropriate clean-up actions in
<var>Handler</var>. 
If an exception occurs during <var>Goal</var>, and the exception code unifies with
<var>ErrorCode</var>, <code>critical_on_exception/3</code> acts as if you had
written
<pre class="example">     critical(<var>Handler</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>instead.  That is, the <var>Handler</var> will still be inside the critical region,
and only the first solution it returns will be taken.

   <p>These forms also have the effect of committing to the first solution of
<var>Goal</var>.  Since the point of a critical region is to ensure that some
operation with side-effects is completed, <var>Goal</var> should be determinate
anyway, so this should be no problem.
