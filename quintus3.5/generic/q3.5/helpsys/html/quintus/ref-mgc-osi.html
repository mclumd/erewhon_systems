<h4 class="subsection">Operating System Interaction</h4>

   <p>This section describes the various system parameters required to run Prolog.

   <p>There is normally no need for you to seek any special
privileges or quotas in order to run Prolog.  Prolog will automatically
expand its space up to the total amount of virtual space you are allowed. 
If it should run out of space, Prolog will raise a resource error.

   <p>This may happen because of an infinite recursion in your program, or it may
be that your program really needs more space than is available. 
Under UNIX, if you are using the C shell (<code>csh</code>), you can find out how much space
is available by means of the <code>csh</code> command <code>limit</code>.  The command
<pre class="example">     % <kbd>limit</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>will list a number of limits of which the relevant one is <code>datasize</code>.  This
number is the number of kilobytes available to Prolog for its data areas. 
You can reduce this limit by typing, for example,
<pre class="example">     % <kbd>limit datasize 2000</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>The main reason that you might want to reduce the limit is that
some systems allow the allocation of
more virtual memory than there is swap space available, and then to crash. 
You can run quite large programs with a datasize of 2000 kilobytes.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>UNIX Caveat:</strong>

        <p>On some UNIX systems, the specified <code>datasize</code> (program) limit
(see <code>limit(csh)</code> and <code>getrlimit(3)</code>) can be grossly higher then the
maximum break that a process can set.  This is because the setting
of the break is dependent upon the amount of swap space available. 
Since all processes share the same swap space, the space available to
any one process is based on the space usage of all other processes
running on the machine.  Therefore, one process that has set a large
program break may prevent another process from doing the same, if
both are running simultaneously. 
</blockquote>

   <p>The Quintus Prolog memory manager makes calculations based upon the
specified <code>datasize</code> limit, since the actual limit cannot be
determined except by experimentation, and even then the limit changes
over time.  Better memory management will result when the
specified <code>datasize</code> limit is close to the actual limit.

   <p>The default behavior of Prolog is tuned to be optimal for a large
class of programs. If the programmers need greater control of the way
Prolog grows and frees memory, they can set environment variables, the
documentation for which follow. Note that the default values for these
variables should satisfy almost all programs and you really do not
need to set these variables at all. 
The values for these variables are entered in bytes, but may be
followed by <code>K</code> or <code>M</code> meaning kilobytes or megabytes respectively.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>PROLOGINITSIZE</code>
     <dd>Controls the size of Prolog's initial memory allocation. 
Can be set to a sufficiently large size to allow the Prolog
application to execute without needing to expand.  This must be done before
Prolog is invoked.

     <p>By default, the value is the minimum memory required for
Prolog to start up.  In addition, the value is constrained to be
at least that amount, regardless of the user setting.

     <br><dt><code>PROLOGMAXSIZE</code>
     <dd>Can be used to place a limit on the amount of data space
that a given Prolog process will use.

     <p>The <code>csh</code> command <code>limit</code> can also be used to set the amount of data space
that can be used by the the current shell and all processes within it.

     <p>By default, the value is effectively infinity, which is to say
that Prolog's expansion will only be limited by the space that the
shell is able to provide it.

     <br><dt><code>PROLOGINCSIZE</code>
     <dd>Can be used to control the
amount of space Prolog asks the operating system for in any given
memory expansion.

     <p>By default, the value is the minimum amount of memory that
will allow Prolog to expand one of its data areas, by kilobytes. In
addition, the value is constrained to be at least that amount,
regardless of the user setting.

     <br><dt><code>PROLOGKEEPSIZE</code>
     <dd>Can be used to control the
amount of space Prolog retains after performing some computation.  By
default, Prolog gets memory from the operating system as the user
program executes and returns all the free memory back to the operating
system when the user program does not need any more. If the programmer
knows that her program once it has grown to a certain size is likely to
need as much memory for future computations, then she can advise Prolog
not to return all the free memory back to the operating system by
setting the value to <var>K</var>.  Once Prolog grows to
<var>K</var> bytes, it will always keep at least <var>K</var> bytes
around. Only memory that was allocated above and beyond <var>K</var> bytes
is returned to the OS.

     <br><dt><code>PROLOGLOCALMIN</code>
     <dd>Can be used to control the
amount of space Prolog reserves for the local stack. The purpose
of the local stack is described in detail in
<a href="ref-mgc.html#ref-mgc">ref-mgc</a>.  The default value is 64Kb.

     <br><dt><code>PROLOGGLOBALMIN</code>
     <dd>Can be used to control the
amount of space Prolog reserves for the global stack. The purpose
of the global stack is described in detail in
<a href="ref-mgc.html#ref-mgc">ref-mgc</a>.  The default value is 64Kb.
