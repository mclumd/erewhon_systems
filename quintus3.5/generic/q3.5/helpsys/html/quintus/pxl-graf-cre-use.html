<h5 class="subsubsection">Using Gcs</h5>

   <p>As we have said, using gcs and using graphics attributes of drawables
may be freely intermixed.  For example, you may have an application
that usually wants a certain set of graphics attributes for a window,
but occasionally wants a very different set.  You could handle this by
setting up the graphics attributes of the window, and changing them
when necessary.  Or you could create two gcs, one with each of the
needed sets of graphics attributes, and specify the correct gc in each
drawing command.  Or you could set the graphics attributes of the
window to the most often needed configuration, and create a separate gc
with the alternate set of attributes, and only specify a gc argument in
drawing commands when you need the alternate set.  Each of these
approaches has its advantages and disadvantages; which you choose is up
to you.

   <p>It is also possible to set the gc a drawable will use when no gc is
specified in a drawing command.  If you need to create many windows or
pixmaps with the same graphics attributes, this is an efficient way to
do it.  You create the gc with the attributes needed by all these
windows, and then when you create the windows, you specify this as
their gc.
