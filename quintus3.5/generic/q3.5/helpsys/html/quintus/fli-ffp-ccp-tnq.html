<h5 class="subsubsection">Terminating a Nondeterminate Prolog Query</h5>

   <p><code>QP_close_query()</code> and <code>QP_cut_query()</code> are functions that are used to
terminate an open nondeterminate Prolog query.  They differ only in their
effect on the Prolog heap, which can be reflected in the solutions
Prolog has returned to C.

   <p>The difference between <code>QP_close_query()</code> and <code>QP_cut_query()</code> can
best be understood with reference to Prolog's control flow. 
<code>QP_close_query()</code> is equivalent to the Prolog call <code>!, fail</code>. 
The cut renders the current computation determinate, removing the
possibility of future backtracking.  The following call to <code>fail/0</code>
then initiates backtracking to the next previous parent goal with
outstanding alternatives.  In doing so it pops the Prolog heap to its
state when the parent goal succeeded, in effect throwing away any
terms created since that parent goal.

   <p>In contrast, just calling <code>!</code> in Prolog renders the computation
determinate without initiating backtracking.  Any terms created since
the parent goal are retained.

   <p>In the context of calling Prolog from foreign languages, terminating a
query using <code>QP_close_query()</code> generally means throwing away the most recent
solution that was calculated, unless that solution has been copied into
a more permanent place.  (Of course, any previous solutions must also
be assumed to have been overwritten by subsequent solutions unless copied
elsewhere!)  The converse of this behavior is that closing a query using
<code>QP_close_query()</code> automatically frees up the Prolog memory that holds
the last solution.

   <p>Terminating a query using <code>QP_cut_query()</code> renders the computation
determinate, but as it is not failed over the Prolog heap is not
popped.  Thus when terminating a query using <code>QP_cut_query()</code> more
space is retained, but so is the most recent solution.
