<h4 class="subsection">Drawing and filling lines and shapes</h4>

   <p>Drawing in ProXL is fairly straightforward, and quite powerful.  ProXL
has primitives to
     <ul>

     <li>draw points, lines, polygons, rectangles, arcs, ellipses (and circles)
<li>fill closed figures with arbitrary patterns
<li>draw or fill multiple items
<li>clear windows
<li>copy part of one drawable into another. 
</ul>

   <p>Programming in ProXL requires a certain way of looking at drawing and
graphics in general.  Think of a line or an ellipse not as an permanent object,
but as a temporary pattern of pixels on the screen. 
When you draw a line, you are
turning bits on.  The next thing you do may turn them off.  Or they
may be turned off when a user overlays your window with another.  The
line that you draw has no permanence.  This property of X, call it
<dfn>procedural drawing,</dfn> makes for a programming style in which you first
open the windows you will need, and then do all drawing in callback
routines (<a href="pxl-bas-tyi-cbk.html#pxl-bas-tyi-cbk">pxl-bas-tyi-cbk</a>).  If you want the line to seem to stay
around, you have to explicitly provide for it to be repainted whenever
it is damaged or obscured by a later event; see <a href="pxl-bas-tyi-rfr.html#pxl-bas-tyi-rfr">pxl-bas-tyi-rfr</a>
on refreshing windows.

   <p>The primitives for drawing or filling a single shape take just the
arguments you would expect:

     <ul>

     <li>the destination window

     <li>the parameters determining the shape to be drawn. 
</ul>

   <p>The primitives for drawing or filling multiple objects are also fairly
simple.  They each take

     <ul>

     <li>the destination window
<li>a list of Prolog terms, each specifying the parameters of a shape to
be drawn or filled. 
</ul>

   <p>In all of the drawing commands, and elsewhere in ProXL, the X
coordinates are given relative to the left edge of the enclosing
window
, and Y
coordinates are given relative to the <dfn>top</dfn> edge.
