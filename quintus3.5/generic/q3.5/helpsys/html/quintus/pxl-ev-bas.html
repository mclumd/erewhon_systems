<h4 class="subsection">Introduction</h4>

   <p>Under X11, events are selected on a per window basis by ORing
individual <dfn>event select</dfn> bitmasks into the <code>event_mask</code> attribute
of the window. To determine which window gets an event, the X server
searches the window hierarchy bottom up, starting with the innermost
window where the event logically happened. If a window <dfn>selects</dfn> that
particular event, it is sent to it. If the window <dfn>discards</dfn> that event,
the event is thrown away and the search stops. If the window neither
selects nor discards the event, the search resumes with its parent. 
Any event that propagates all the way up to the root window without being
selected, is discarded anyway.

   <p>When using ProXL, in most cases, the user does not need to know
about bitmasks. Events are selected by name, and Prolog routines
are attached to Windows to handle the conditions.

   <p>The ProXL
event handler mechanism receives X11 events, extracts
user-specified values and calls the
appropriate callback routine.

   <p>If there is no registered callback for a given event (including
<dfn>default</dfn> handlers, as specified later), the event
is quietly discarded.

   <p>If multiple callbacks are registered for an event in a Window
(as might be the case for <code>button_press</code> or <code>button_release</code>
events),
they are tried sequentially until one succeeds, at which point
the callback is considered satisfied and no more alternatives are tried. 
If all the registered callbacks fail, the event is quietly discarded.

   <p>Callbacks are Window attributes, and are established using
<code>put_window_attributes/N</code>, or <code>create_window/N</code>,
using one of the following attribute formats:

<pre class="example">     callback(+<var>EventSpec</var>, +<var>EventValues</var>, +<var>ExitVar</var>, +<var>Context</var>, +<var>Goal</var>)
     callback(+<var>EventSpec</var>, +<var>EventValues</var>, +<var>ExitVar</var>, +<var>Goal</var>)
     callback(+<var>EventSpec</var>, +<var>EventValues</var>, +<var>Goal</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>EventSpec</var> is a description of the event that should cause
the user-supplied callback <var>Goal</var>, a Prolog goal, to be called.

   <p><var>EventValues</var> is either a list of the event fields that the user wants
to be supplied as arguments to <var>Goal</var>
, or the term <code>xevent(</code><var>E</var><code>)</code>, which instructs
ProXL
to deliver the whole event structure, in the same internal format
used by the event handling functions described in <a href="pxl-evf.html#pxl-evf">pxl-evf</a>.

   <p><var>ExitVar</var>, if supplied, is either a term that is bound by <var>Goal</var>
when the user wants to exit the event handling
loop and return, or the atom <code>none</code>. If omitted,
it defaults to <code>none</code> and <var>Goal</var> is assumed to not contain an exit
variable.

   <p><var>Context</var>, if supplied, is a term that will be  unified with the
<var>Context</var> argument supplied to <code>handle_events/[2,3]</code> when
the callback <var>Goal</var> is executed. If omitted, it defaults to <code>none</code>. 
If the user calls <code>handle_events/[0,1]</code>, <var>Goal</var> will be called
with <var>Context</var> unbound.
