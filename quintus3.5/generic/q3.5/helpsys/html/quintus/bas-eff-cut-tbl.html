<h5 class="subsubsection">Terminating a Backtracking Loop</h5>

   <p>Cut is also commonly used in conjunction with the generate-and-test
programming paradigm.  For example, consider the predicate <code>find_solution/1</code>
defined by
<pre class="example">     find_solution(X) :-
             candidate_solution(X),
             test_solution(X),
             !.
     </pre>

   <p>where <code>candidate_solution/1</code> generates possible answers on backtracking. 
The intent is to stop generating candidates
as soon as one is found that satisfies <code>test_solution/1</code>.  If the cut were
omitted, a future failure could cause backtracking into this clause and
restart the generation of candidate solutions.  A similar example is shown
below:

<pre class="example">     process_file(F) :-
             see(F),
             repeat,
                 read(X),
                 process_and_fail(X),
             !,
             seen.
     
     process_and_fail(end_of_file) :- !.
     process_and_fail(X) :-
             process(X),
             fail.
     </pre>

   <p>The cut in <code>process_file/1</code> is another example of terminating a
generate-and-test loop.  In general, a cut should always be placed after a
<code>repeat/0</code> so that the backtracking loop is clearly terminated.  If the cut
were omitted in this case, on later backtracking Prolog might try to read
another term after the end of the file had been reached.

   <p>The cut in <code>process_and_fail/1</code> might be considered unnecessary because,
assuming the call shown is the only call to it, the cut in <code>process_file/1</code>
ensures that backtracking into <code>process_and_fail/1</code> can never happen.  While
this is true, it is also a good safeguard to include a cut in
<code>process_and_fail/1</code> because someone may unwittingly change <code>process_file/1</code>
in the future.
