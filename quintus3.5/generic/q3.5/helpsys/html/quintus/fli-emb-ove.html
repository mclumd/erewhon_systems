<h4 class="subsection">Overview</h4>

   <p>As outlined in <a href="int-hig.html#int-hig">int-hig</a>, a constellation of new features
greatly extends the relationship between Quintus Prolog code and foreign language
code.  It is now possible to embed Prolog code in a program written in
another language without restrictions.  Clearly, the first requirement
for embedding Prolog code freely in foreign code is to be able
to call Prolog from foreign code and vice versa. 
C calling Prolog is a major new feature of release 3 and is discussed
in <a href="fli-ffp.html#fli-ffp">fli-ffp</a>.

   <p>A further requirement is that all types of data structures can be
passed between Prolog and the foreign code.  Previously it was not
possible to pass compound Prolog terms between Prolog and foreign
code.  In addition there were serious limitations on passing mathematical
data.  release 3 adds
     <ul>

     <li>the ability to access Prolog terms from the foreign language once
they are passed to it and perform Prolog operations on them. 
(Discussed in detail in <a href="fli-p2f.html#fli-p2f">fli-p2f</a> and <a href="fli-ffp.html#fli-ffp">fli-ffp</a>, and in the
reference pages cited there for term passing predicates and functions). 
<li>the ability to access data structures in a foreign language from
Prolog and to perform destructive operations on them.  (Discussed in
<a href="fli-p2f-poi.html#fli-p2f-poi">fli-p2f-poi</a> and <code>assign/2</code> and <code>is/2</code>). 
<li>32 bit integers and 64 bit floats
</ul>

   <p>With these new features, Quintus Prolog fulfills the full data passing requirement.

   <p>The foreign language interface is now fully bidirectional.  This in
itself is not sufficient for embeddability in a strong sense.  The
Prolog portions of the application must in addition be
<em>well-behaved</em>.  That is, they must not make any assumptions about
how the operating system will handle such matters as memory and
input/output operations.  This is where the <dfn>embedding layer</dfn> of
Quintus Prolog comes in.
