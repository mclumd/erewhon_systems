<h4 class="subsection">Reading and Writing Lines -- <code>library(lineio)</code></h4>

   <p><code>library(lineio)</code> defines some commands for reading and writing lines of text.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>get_line(</code><var>-Chars</var><code>, </code><var>-Terminator</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>

     <p>reads characters from the current input stream until it finds
an end-of-line character.  <var>Chars</var> is unified with a list containing
all the character codes other than the end-of-line character,
and <var>Terminator</var> is unified with the end-of-line character.  This allows
you to check which character ended the line; in particular you
should be prepared to handle the <code>is_endfile(</code><var>Terminator</var><code>)</code> case. 
When the end of a file is encountered, there may have been a partial
line preceding it; so when <code>is_endfile(</code><var>Terminator</var><code>)</code>, <var>Chars</var> may or may
not be the empty list.

     <p><code>get_line/2</code> is normally called with <var>Chars</var> unbound.  A call to <code>get_line/2</code>
with <var>Chars</var> <em>bound</em> will behave similarly to
<code>get0/1</code> in that even if the line of characters does not unify with <var>Chars</var>,
nevertheless the entire line is consumed and is irretrievable. 
Thus, if you call <code>get_line("fred", Eol)</code> and the next
line of input is in fact <code>jim</code> or <code>frederica</code>, the entire line will
have been read before the call to <code>get_line/2</code> fails.  Only call <code>get_line/2</code>
with <var>Chars</var> bound when you want the line to be thrown away if it
does not match.  For example, if you want to skip until you encounter a line
containing only a single <code>.</code> (a convention some editors and
some mailers use for the end of terminal input), you can write
     <pre class="example">          ...
          skip_through_line(".")
          </pre>

     <p>where
     <pre class="example">          skip_through_line(X) :-
                  repeat,
                      get_line(X, _),
                  !.
          </pre>

     <p>(<code>skip_through_line/1</code> is not in the library.)

     <br><dt><code>get_line(</code><var>-Chars</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is used for the common case in which you are uninterested in what the
end-of-line character was, provided it was not end-of-file.  <code>get_line/1</code>
reads a whole line, just like <code>get_line/2</code>, then checks that the line
terminator was not the end-of-file character, and unifies the list
of character codes with <var>Chars</var>.  If <var>Chars</var> is instantiated and does not
match the line that is read, or if the line terminator was end-of-file,
<code>get_line/1</code> fails quietly (with the same consequences regarding the loss of
the non-matching text as with <code>get_line/2</code> above).

     <br><dt><code>fget_line(</code><var>+Stream</var><code>, </code><var>?Chars</var><code>, </code><var>?Terminator</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>like <code>get_line/2</code> except
that <var>Stream</var> is specified.

     <br><dt><code>fget_line(</code><var>+Stream</var><code>, </code><var>?Chars</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>like <code>get_line/1</code> except that
<var>Stream</var> is specified.

     <br><dt><code>put_chars(</code><var>+Chars</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is a generalization of <code>put/1</code>.  <var>Chars</var> should be instantiated to
a (possibly empty) list of character codes.  The corresponding
characters are written to the
current output stream.  If you know the characters in advance,
it is better to use <code>write/1</code>; for example,
     <pre class="example">          put_chars("they do the same thing")
          </pre>

     <p>and
     <pre class="example">          write('they do the same thing')
          </pre>

     <p>both write exactly the same characters to the current output stream, but
the latter is more efficient.  Use <code>put_chars/1</code> when you
already have the text you want to write as a list of character codes,
<code>write/1</code> when you have the text as an atom.

     <br><dt><code>put_line(</code><var>+Chars</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes the list of character codes <var>Chars</var>, then writes a newline
character.  It produces exactly the same output that
     <pre class="example">          put_chars(<var>Chars</var>), nl
          </pre>

     <p>would, but is generally more convenient.  If you are reading lines from
one file using <code>get_line/1</code> and writing them to another, <code>put_line/1</code> is the
predicate to use.
