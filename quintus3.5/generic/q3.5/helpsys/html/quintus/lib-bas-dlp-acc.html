<h5 class="subsubsection">Accessing Code Comments</h5>

   <p>If you know the name of the library package in question, simply look
at the source code in <code>qplib3.5</code>.  Apart from code
comments, there is information about predicates in two files that
summarize the contents of the directory.  They are called <code>Contents</code> and
<code>Index</code>.  (See the figure above.)  If you do not know the name of the
package the <code>Index</code> file will be helpful.  If you know the name of the
package, you can use the <code>Contents</code> file to gain further information
about it.

   <p>The <code>Index</code> file contains one line for each exported predicate in
the library.  The predicates are listed in standard
order, ignoring module names.  A typical
entry looks like this:
<pre class="example">     list_to_binary/4   flatten   ./flatten.pl
     </pre>

   <p>This means that there is a predicate called <code>list_to_binary/4</code> in
the library, that it lives in a module called <code>flatten</code>, and
that the file that contains it is <code>flatten.pl</code> in the same
directory as the Index.

   <p>If you have set up an environment variable <code>QL</code> holding the
name of the Quintus library directory, you could ask
"what predicates are there to deal with files?" by issuing
the command
<pre class="example">     % <kbd>egrep files $QL/Index</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>The <code>Contents</code> file is organized by library files rather than by
predicates.  A typical entry in this file is a block of lines like
this:
<pre class="example">     basics  + documented in manual
     basics  % the basic list processing predicates
     basics  - ./basics.pl
     basics  : member/2
     basics  : memberchk/2
     basics  : nonmember/2
     </pre>

   <p>The first line means that <code>library(basics)</code> is one of the library
packages that is fully documented in this manual.  The second line is
a short description of the contents.  The third line says which file
contains <code>library(basics)</code>; in this case it is <code>basics.pl</code> in the same
directory as Contents.  The remaining lines list the predicates
exported by <code>library(basics)</code>.  You could obtain this information by
issuing the command
<pre class="example">     % <kbd>egrep '^basics' $QL/Contents</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>These files are provided as a convenience, and do not have the
same authority as the printed manual.
