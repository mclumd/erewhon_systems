<h4 class="subsection">Overview</h4>

   <p>We recommend that if you are just starting out, do <em>not</em> use this
package.  The TCP package is much faster and more powerful. 
IPC/RPC is not available under Windows.

   <p>In releases prior to Quintus Prolog Release 2.5, this package was simply known
as IPC.  It is now called IPC/RPC to distinguish it from another
interprocess communication package, which is called IPC/TCP.  That
package is more general than this one since its facilities can be used
to implement the functionality of this package.

   <p>This package has some interesting facilities for calling a Prolog servant
from C.  Before Release 3.0, this was the only way to call Prolog from C. 
Now Prolog can be fully embedded in a C application.

   <p>This Interprocess Communication (IPC) package provides tools for
allowing programs written in Prolog or C to remotely call predicates
in a Prolog program that is running as a separate process, possibly
on a different machine.  The communication between the processes is
implemented using sockets or pipes to send goals to the remote process
and to retrieve answers back.

   <p>We refer to the Prolog process that is
being invoked by some other program as a <dfn>servant</dfn>, because it provides
a goal evaluation service at the request of another program:  it is given
a goal to invoke, invokes it, and then returns the answers to the caller. 
It is called a servant, as opposed to a server, because it serves a single
master.  We refer to the program that is calling the servant as the
<dfn>master</dfn>.  The interface described here permits a program (the master)
to call <em>one</em> servant and use it to evaluate many subgoals.  The
characteristics of the interface vary somewhat with the programming
language of the master.  If the master is itself a Prolog program, then
the interface can be much more flexible than when the calling program is
written in a procedural language, such as C.  We divide the description of
the interface into two parts:  (1) when the master program is written in
Prolog, and (2) when the master program is written in C.  Although only C
calling Prolog is documented, other languages can also call Prolog if they
adhere to the specified protocol.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> On System V versions of UNIX or VMS, the master and server
processes are currently required to run on the same machine, and the
communication is via pipes rather than sockets.  On UNIX systems based
on BSD, such as SunOS 4.x, the user can choose to use either pipes or
sockets, provided that the two processes are on the same machine. 
Sockets must be used when the processes are on separate machines. 
When sockets are used, there needs to be an entry in the <code>/etc/hosts</code>
file(s) for each machine that is used.
