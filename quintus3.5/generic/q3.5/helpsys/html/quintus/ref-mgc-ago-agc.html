<h5 class="subsubsection">The Atom Garbage Collector User Interface</h5>

   <p>Because the creation of atoms does not follow any other system behaviors
like memory growth or heap garbage collection, Quintus has chosen to
keep the invocation of atom garbage collection independent of any other
operation and to keep the invocation of atom garbage collection explicit
rather than making it automatic.  It is often preferable for the programmer to
control when it will occur in case preparations need to be made for it.

   <p>Atom garbage collection is invoked by calling the new built-in predicate
<code>garbage_collect_atoms/0</code>. 
The predicate normally succeeds silently.  The user may determine whether
to invoke atom garbage collection at a given point based on information
returned from a call to <code>statistics/2</code> with the keyword <code>atoms</code>. 
That call returns a list of the form

<pre class="example">     [<var>number of atoms</var>, <var>atom space in use</var>, <var>atom space free</var>]
     </pre>

   <p>For example,

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>statistics(atoms, Stats).</kbd>
     
     Stats = [4313,121062,31032]
     </pre>

   <p>One would typically choose to call <code>garbage_collect_atoms/0</code> prior
to each iteration of an iterative application, when
either the number of atoms or the atom space in use passes some threshold,
e.g.

<pre class="example">     &lt;driver loop&gt; :-
             ...
             repeat,
                maybe_atom_gc,
                &lt;do next iteration&gt;
                ...
             fail.
     &lt;driver loop&gt;.
     </pre>

   <p>where

<pre class="example">     maybe_atom_gc :-
             statistics(atoms, [_,Inuse,_]),
             atom_gc_space_threshold(Space),
             ( Inuse &gt; Space -&gt; garbage_collect_atoms ; true ).
     
     % Atom GC if there are more than 100000 bytes of atoms:
     atom_gc_space_threshold(100000).
     </pre>

   <p>More sophisticated approaches might use both atom number and atom space
thresholds, or could adjust a threshold if atom garbage collection
didn't free an adequate number of atoms.

   <p>To be most effective, atom
garbage collection should be called when as few as possible atoms are
actually in use.  In the above example, for instance, it makes the most
sense to do atom garbage collection at the beginning of each iteration
rather than at the end, as at the beginning of the iteration the previous
failure may just have freed large amounts of atom-rich global and local stack. 
Similarly, it's better to invoke atom garbage collection after abolishing
or retracting a large database than to do so before.
