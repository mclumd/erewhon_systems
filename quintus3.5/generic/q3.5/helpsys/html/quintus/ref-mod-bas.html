<h4 class="subsection">Basic Concepts</h4>

   <p>Each predicate in a program is identified by its <dfn>module</dfn>, as well as by
its name and arity.

   <p>A module defines a set of predicates, some of which have the property
of being <dfn>public</dfn>.  Public predicates are predicates that can be
<dfn>imported</dfn> by other modules, which means that they can then be
called from within those modules.  Predicates that are not public are
<dfn>private</dfn> to the module in which they are defined; that is, they
cannot be called from outside that module (except by explicitly
overriding the modularity rules as described in <a href="ref-mod-vis.html#ref-mod-vis">ref-mod-vis</a>).

   <p>There are two kinds of importation:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>A module <var>M1</var> may import a specified set of predicates from another
module <var>M2</var>.  All the specified predicates should be public in <var>M2</var>. 
<li>A module <var>M1</var> may import all the public predicates of another module
<var>M2</var>.
        </ol>

   <p>Built-in predicates do not need to be imported; they are automatically
available from within any module.

   <p>There is a special module called <code>user</code>, which is used by default when
predicates are being defined and no other module has been specified.

   <p>If you are using a program written by someone else, you need not be
concerned as to whether or not that program has been made into a module. 
The act of loading a module from a file using <code>compile/1</code>,
or <code>ensure_loaded/1</code> (see <a href="ref-lod.html#ref-lod">ref-lod</a>) will automatically import
all the public predicates in that module.  Thus the command
<pre class="example">     :- ensure_loaded(library(basics)).
     </pre>

   <p>will load the basic list-processing predicates from the library and make
them available.
