<h4 class="subsection">Understanding Prolog Execution Using The Debugger</h4>

   <p>The Quintus Prolog debugger extends the procedure box control flow model to add
extra information about the details of the execution of a goal,
allowing you to better understand how your code behaves, and its
efficiency.

   <p>Prolog incorporates a <dfn>backtracking</dfn> mechanism as
a basic feature, which allows Prolog programs to efficiently search for
multiple solutions to a problem.  A goal is <dfn>determinate</dfn>

   <p>if it has only one solution (or
none).  Often, this is what is desired.  When a goal is not determinate,
Prolog must keep around information to allow it to backtrack to look for
alternate solutions.  This extra information is called a
<dfn>choice point</dfn>
.

   <p>When a goal is intended to be nondeterminate, it may be expected to
leave a choice point.  However, when a goal that is expected to be
determinate leaves a choice point, this may indicate an error in the
program.  In this case, the goal might succeed with the correct
answer, but on backtracking produce wrong answers or not terminate. 
At the very least, an unnecessary choice point means that memory is
being wasted.  Quintus Prolog detects many kinds of determinate goals, and either
does not allocate a choice point at all, or deallocates it as soon as
possible, saving time and memory (see <a href="bas-eff-cut-ove.html#bas-eff-cut-ove">bas-eff-cut-ove</a>). 
Sometimes, however, you must help Prolog out by putting a cut

   <p>(see <a href="bas-eff-cut-mpd.html#bas-eff-cut-mpd">bas-eff-cut-mpd</a>) in your program, or by using an if-then-else (see
<a href="ref-sem-con.html#ref-sem-con">ref-sem-con</a>) construct.  The Quintus
Prolog debugger helps you find such cases.

   <p>Quintus Prolog <dfn>index</dfn><b>es</b><dfn></dfn>
 on the first argument of a
predicate.  This means that if the first arguments in the clauses of a
predicate are not variables, and the first argument in a call to that
predicate is non-variable, then Prolog will go directly to the clause that
matches, without even considering those that don't. Note that in order
for this indexing to be very efficient, it only looks at the principal
functor of a compound term.  This means that if the first argument of
one clause is a(a) and the first argument of the next clause is a(b),
indexing will not be able to distinguish these clauses, so both will
need to be tried.

   <p>Actually, indexing is more complicated than this.  Any clause whose head
has a variable as first argument will match any call, so indexing cannot
be applied to this clause.  Therefore, a predicate can be divided into
alternating groups of adjacent indexable and nonindexable clauses.  When
the first argument of a call is non-variable, Quintus Prolog will skip over any clauses
that don't match that argument, within a group of adjacent indexable
clauses.  Quintus Prolog will then try every clause in a group of adjacent
nonindexable clauses, and then again skip nonmatching clause in an
indexable group, and so on.

   <p>Even more important than time saved by indexing is its effect on
determinacy.  In effect, indexing makes it possible to ignore clauses
<em>following</em> the clause being tried, as well as clauses preceding
it.  If it is possible to ignore all the clauses following the clause
being tried, then Prolog will not create a choice point, or if a
choice point has already been allocated for the call, Prolog will
de-allocate it.  Careful use of indexing can save a great deal time and
memory running your program.

   <p>The Quintus Prolog debugger helps you understand these efficiency concerns, and
also Quintus Prolog's exception handling, by extending the box model with three
extra ports.  These ports are described below.

     <dl>

     <br><dt>Done
     <dd>This is just like the Exit port,
but signifies a determinate exit.  This will help you to find goals that
are nondeterminate and shouldn't be.

     <br><dt>Head
     <dd>This port shows the clauses' heads that will be tried for unification. 
At the Head port, you will see which clause is about to be tried, and
which clause will be tried next if this clause fails.  Note that the
Head port is shown <em>after</em> indexing is done, so it helps you
understand how indexing is working for you.  And since it shows what
clause will be tried next, it also helps you understand how unexpected
nondeterminacy may be creeping into your program.

     <br><dt>Exception
     <dd>The Exception port
signifies an exception being raised while executing a goal.

   </dl>

   <p>Here's a more complete picture of the invocation box, including the
extended ports.
