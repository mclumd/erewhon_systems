<h4 class="subsection">Selective saving and loading of QOF files</h4>

   <p>The <code>save_program/[1,2]</code> and <code>restore/1</code> predicates discussed in
the previous section are used for saving and restoring the entire Prolog
database. To save selected parts of a Prolog database, the predicates
<code>save_modules/2</code> and <code>save_predicates/2</code> are used.

   <p>For example, to save the modules <code>user</code> and <code>special</code> you would use:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>save_modules([user,special],'file1.qof').</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>All predicates in those modules will be saved, and in addition any foreign
code files previously loaded into these modules will generate an object file
dependency in the QOF file.  All information in these modules about
predicates attached to foreign functions, and also predicates that have
been made externally callable from foreign code, is saved as a normal
part of the module.

   <p>For each module imported by one of the specified modules, a QOF file
dependency is included in the QOF file.  This means that when you load
<code>file1.qof</code> into another Prolog session, it will automatically load
any additional QOF files that it needs.

   <p>To just save certain predicates you would use:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>save_predicates([person/2,dept/4],'file2.qof').</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>This will only save the predicates specified. In this case no additional
dependency information is saved into the QOF file. Note that the module information for these predicates is included. When the QOF file is loaded
the predicates will be loaded into the same module they were in originally.

   <p>Any QOF file, however generated, can be loaded into Prolog with
<code>load_files/[1,2]</code>:

<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>load_files('file1.qof')</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>or, equivalently:
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>['file1.qof'].</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>The information from each QOF file loaded is incrementally added to the
database.  This means that definitions from later loads may replace
definitions from previous loads.  A saved-state QOF file saved with
<code>save_program/[1,2]</code> can also be loaded with <code>load_files/[1,2]</code> in
which case the contents of the saved-state are just incrementally added to
the database as for any other QOF file.  The use of <code>load_files/[1,2]</code>
for this is different from the use of <code>restore/1</code> in that <code>restore/1</code>
will re-execute the executable thus reinitializing the database. Using
<code>load_files/[1,2]</code> allows the database to be incrementally changed
within the same process.

   <p>If the loaded QOF file has object file dependencies then those object
files will be linked and loaded as part of loading the QOF file unless
they have already been loaded. If the object file cannot be found or
linked, then an exception will be raised.

   <p>The predicates <code>load_files/[1,2]</code> are used for compiling and
loading source files as well as QOF files.  If <code>file1.qof</code> and
<code>file1.pl</code> both exist (and <code>file1</code> does not), then <code>load_files</code>
(file 1) will load the source (<code>.pl</code>) or the QOF, whichever is the most
recent.  Refer to <a href="ref-lod.html#ref-lod">ref-lod</a> for more information on
loading programs, and also to the reference page for
<code>load_files/[1,2]</code>.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Advanced note:</strong>  Both <code>save_modules/2</code> and <code>save_predicates/2</code> will
save Prolog code that is statically linked if such modules or predicates are
specified.  This is different from <code>save_program/[1,2]</code>, which will not
save statically linked Prolog code.  Note that if such a QOF file is loaded
back into the same executable that saved it, then the new definitions from
the QOF file will replace the statically linked code.  There is no problem
with this, except that some space will be wasted.  The original statically
linked code will not be used, but since it is linked into the executable its
space cannot be reclaimed.  Since static linking is normally used to
optimize start-up time and the space usage for code, it is somewhat of a
waste to circumvent this by saving and loading a lot of Prolog code that is
already in the executable.  If the QOF file is to be used for other
purposes, such as re-linking the executable, or as a part to be loaded into
another program, then, of course, the saving of statically linked code is
probably exactly what is required.
