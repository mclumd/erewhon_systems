<h4 class="subsection">Predicates not supported by the Runtime Kernel</h4>

   <p>The predicates listed below are not supported by the Runtime Kernel, since their
purpose is to aid the development process rather than to be used in application
programs.  <code>qld</code> or <code>qcon</code> will print <code>Undefined</code> warning
messages if you try to build a runtime system with calls to any of
these predicates. At run time, these calls will raise existence
errors in a runtime system.

     <dl>

     <br><dt>debugger:
     <dd><code>debug/0</code>, <code>nodebug/0</code>, <code>trace/0</code>, <code>notrace/0</code>,
<code>spy/1</code>, <code>nospy/1</code>, <code>nospyall/0</code>, <code>debugging/0</code>,
<code>leash/1</code>, <code>add_spypoint/1</code>, <code>current_spypoint/1</code>,
<code>remove_spypoint/1</code>,

     <br><dt>help system:
     <dd><code>help/[0,1]</code>, <code>manual/[0,1]</code>

     <br><dt>advice:
     <dd><code>add_advice/3</code>, <code>check_advice/[0,1]</code>,
<code>current_advice/3</code>, <code>nocheck_advice/[0,1]</code>,
<code>remove_advice/3</code>,

     <br><dt>program development:
     <dd><code>break/0</code>

   </dl>

   <p>If you call any of these predicates from compile-time code, such as from an
embedded command or in a definition of <code>term_expansion/2</code>, the call will
raise existence errors when using <code>qpc</code>.

   <p>Any use of these predicates should be eliminated from both your
run-time and your compile-time code, unless you can be sure that they
won't be called or you don't mind them raising existence errors.

   <p>In addition, the predicates
<code>load_foreign_files/2</code> and <code>load_foreign_executable/1</code> are
not available in the Runtime Kernel but may
be used in embedded commands.  That is, you can use them at compile
time, in order to link foreign code into your program, but you cannot
use them when the runtime system is running.

   <p>Since the compiler is not included in a runtime system, the effect of
the load predicates is altered in a runtime system.  Whenever one of
these predicates would normally compile a file into memory, it instead
loads that file into memory as dynamic.  This is equivalent to

<pre class="example">     <code>load_files(file, all_dynamic(true)</code>).
     </pre>

   <p>This should not
normally make any significant difference, except that loading the file
is faster and running it is slower.

   <p>The predicate <code>multifile_assertz/1</code> cannot be used on compiled (static)
predicates in a runtime system.  This restriction does not apply to
predicates that are loaded by <code>compile(</code><var>File</var><code>)</code> at run time, since
such predicates are really loaded as dynamic.
