<h5 class="subsubsection">Basic Information</h5>

   <p>To load a program from Emacs into Prolog, start up the Emacs/Prolog
interface by typing <kbd>prolog +</kbd> at the main operating system prompt. 
When the Emacs/Prolog screen appears, type <kbd>^x ^f</kbd> (for
<code>find-file</code>) followed by the name of the file that contains your
program.  (Alternatively, you can type <kbd>prolog +</kbd> followed by the
name of the file that contains your program.)  After you enter the
Emacs/Prolog environment, activate the window containing your file.

   <p>At this point, you have three options:  you can load

     <ul>

     <li>the entire buffer containing your file (<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; k b</kbd>)
<li>a portion of the program that you have marked (<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; k r</kbd>)
<li>or a single procedure (<kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; k p</kbd>)
</ul>

   <p>Being able to load a designated portion of your program is very
convenient if you are running a program and discover that you
need to make a few changes to improve the program.  You
can make your changes and then reload just the changed portions, without reloading the entire program.  If you
are just beginning a Prolog session, however, you will probably
want to load the entire buffer containing your program using <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; k b</kbd>.

   <p>When you type <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; k</kbd>, Emacs displays the following prompt line
at the bottom of the screen:
<pre class="example">     compile prolog ... enter p for procedure, r for region or b for buffer
     </pre>

   <p>In response, you can type <kbd>b</kbd> to load the entire buffer:
or you can type <kbd>r</kbd> to load a region, or <kbd>p</kbd> to load a
procedure, as described below.

   <p>After you indicate how much of your program to load, the
cursor moves to the Prolog window, and
Prolog displays a message that tells you it is loading the program. 
As it proceeds, Prolog displays messages to let you know which
procedures are being loaded.  For example, if your
program consisted of procedures for <code>parts_of/2</code>, <code>assembly/2</code>, and
<code>inventory/2</code>, Prolog would display the messages:

<pre class="example">     % compiling procedure parts_of/2 in module user
     % compiling procedure assembly/2 in module user
     % compiling procedure inventory/2 in module user
     </pre>

   <p>After Prolog has finished loading, it displays a message such as:
<pre class="example">     % compilation completed, 0.083 sec 448 bytes
     | ?-
     </pre>

   <p>At this point, you can begin to run your program (see
<a href="bas-run.html#bas-run">bas-run</a>).

   <p><strong>Please notes:</strong>
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>When you load procedures into Prolog, Prolog first removes any
previous versions of those procedures from its database, excepting
those procedures that have been declared multifile.  A multifile
declaration indicates that a particular procedure is defined by
clauses in more than one file.  (For more information on multifile
procedures, see <a href="sap-rge-dspn.html#sap-rge-dspn">sap-rge-dspn</a>.)  This is why the entirety
of a procedure must be loaded at once; otherwise, loading the
definition of the second part would wipe out the definition of the
first part. 
<li>The <kbd>&lt;ESC&gt; k</kbd> commands can also be issued from the debugger prompt, as
described in <a href="dbg-bas-bas.html#dbg-bas-bas">dbg-bas-bas</a>
.
