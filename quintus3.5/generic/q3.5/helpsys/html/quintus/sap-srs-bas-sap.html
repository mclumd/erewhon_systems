<h5 class="subsubsection">Stand-Alone Programs</h5>

   <p>A stand-alone Prolog program is a single, standard, executable file
that can be considered to be an extended version of the Development
System, with your Prolog and foreign code being pre-loaded into it. 
This approach has several advantages as compared with the saved-state
approach:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Since a stand-alone program is a standard executable file, you can use
standard source-level debugging tools such as <code>gdb(1)</code> to debug your
foreign code at the source level.

     <li>Standard tools such as <code>make(1)</code> can be easily used to construct
your program, ensuring that everything is up-to-date.  This is
particularly useful if you are using a lot of foreign code. 
<li>Startup is faster. 
<li>Your code (except for dynamic predicates) will be loaded into the text
segment, so that it will be shared if the program is to be run by more
than one process at a time on a single machine.

     <li>Different application programs can share compiled files.  The format
of compiled files, "Quintus Object Format" or QOF, is portable
across a number of different hardware types and operating systems.
        </ol>

   <p>The disadvantage of linking, in comparison with using a saved
state, is that the stand-alone program will require more disk space
than a saved state, since it contains the Development Kernel and the
user's foreign code.
