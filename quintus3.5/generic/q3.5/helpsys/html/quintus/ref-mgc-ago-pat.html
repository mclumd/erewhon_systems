<h5 class="subsubsection">Protecting Atoms in Foreign Memory</h5>

   <p>Quintus Prolog's foreign language interface allows atoms to be passed to foreign
functions.  When calling foreign functions from Prolog, atoms are passed
via the <code>+atom</code> argument type in the predicate specifications of
<code>foreign/[2,3]</code> facts.  The strings of atoms can be
passed to foreign functions via the <code>+string</code> argument type.  In the
latter case a pointer to the Prolog symbol table's copy of the string for
an atom is what is passed.  When calling Prolog from C, atoms are passed
back from C to Prolog using the <code>-atom</code> and <code>-string</code> argument
types in <code>extern/1</code> declarations.  Atoms can also be created in foreign
code via functions like <code>QP_atom_from_string()</code>.

   <p>Prolog does not keep track of atoms (or strings of
atoms) stored in foreign memory. 
As such, it cannot
guarantee that those atoms will be retained by atom garbage collection. 
Therefore Quintus Prolog provides functions to <dfn>register</dfn>
atoms (or their strings) with the atom garbage collector.  Registered atoms
will not be reclaimed by the atom garbage collector.  Atoms can be
registered while it is undesirable for them to be reclaimed, and then
unregistered when they are no longer needed.

   <p>Of course, the majority of atoms passed as atoms or strings to foreign
functions do not need to be registered.  Only those that will be stored
across foreign function calls (in global variables)
or across nested calls to Prolog are at risk.  An extra margin of
control is given by the fact the programmer always invokes atom garbage
collection explicitly, and can ensure that this is only done in contexts
that are "safe" for the individual application.

   <p>To register or unregister an atom, one of the following functions is used:

<pre class="example">     int QP_register_atom(atom)
     QP_atom atom;
     
     int QP_unregister_atom(atom)
     QP_atom atom;
     </pre>

   <p>These functions return either <code>QP_ERROR</code> or a non-negative integer.  The
return values are discussed further in <a href="ref-mgc-ago-are.html#ref-mgc-ago-are">ref-mgc-ago-are</a>.

   <p>As noted above, when an atom is passed as a string (<code>+string</code>) to a foreign
function, the string the foreign function receives is the one in Prolog's
symbol table.  When atom garbage collection reclaims the atom for that
string, the space for the string will also be reclaimed.

   <p>Thus, if the string is to be stored across foreign calls then either
a copy of the string or else the atom (<code>+atom</code>) should be passed into the
foreign function so that it can be registered and
<code>QP_string_from_atom()</code> can be used to access the string from the atom.

   <p>Keep in mind that the registration of atoms only pertains to those
passed to foreign functions or created in foreign code.  Atoms in Prolog's
data areas are maintained automatically.  Note also that even
though an atom may be unregistered in foreign code, atom garbage
collection still may not reclaim it as it may be referenced from Prolog's
data areas.  But if an atom is registered in foreign code, it will be
preserved regardless of its presence in Prolog's data areas.

   <p>The following example illustrates the use of these functions. In this
example the current value of an object (which an atom) is being stored
in a C global variable. There are two C functions that can be called from
Prolog, one to update the current value and one to access the value.

<pre class="example">     #include &lt;quintus/quintus.h&gt;
     
     QP_atom current_object = NULL;
     
     update_object(newvalue)
     QP_atom newvalue;
     {
             /* if current_object contains an atom, unregister it */
             if (current_object)
                     (void) QP_unregister_atom(current_object);
     
             /* register new value */
             (void) QP_register_atom(newvalue);
             current_object = newvalue;
     }
     
     QP_atom get_object()
     {
             return current_object;
     }
     </pre>
