<h5 class="subsubsection">Defining your own main()</h5>

   <p>Normally, when building an executable with <code>qld</code> the Quintus <code>main()</code>
routine is linked in to the executable, which initializes the Prolog
environment and calls <code>QP_toplevel()</code>.  <code>QP_toplevel()</code> will either:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Start an interactive top-level, which prompts for a command to be
typed; or
<li>Call runtime(start) in the case of a runtime system
(i.e. if <code>-D</code> was omitted in the call to <code>qld</code>).
        </ol>

   <p>However, you are not limited to using this default <code>main()</code>.  You can
define your <code>main()</code> and have Prolog as a function call.

   <p>This should be done if the Prolog component(s) of your
application are such that they may not be called in a given run of the
program.  In that case, you would not want to initialize Prolog unless
it became necessary.

   <p>An example of this sort of case is a program written in C
that utilizes menus.  The end user can select a number of options. 
One of these options involves further decision making, and runs an
expert system written in Prolog.  If the user doesn't happen to select
this menu option on a given occasion, there is no reason to use the
resources involved in initializing Prolog.  So you would write a <code>main()</code>
that is dependent upon this menu selection.  Once the user selects
this option and thus starts up Prolog, however, subsequent invocations
will recognize that Prolog is already initialized and will not do it again.

   <p>Another situation where it makes sense to "redefine" <code>main()</code> is where
you already have a large application written in C or some other foreign
language and you wish to extend it with a module written in Prolog
without having to rewrite the top level of the existing program.

   <p>If you choose to use a different <code>main()</code>, you should be aware that the
default Quintus <code>main()</code> provides certain functionality, which will have to be
included in the user-supplied <code>main()</code>:

     <ul>

     <li>Initialize memory, I/O. 
<li>Set up command line arguments. 
<li>Initialize file search paths, file tables and symbol tables. 
<li>Do start up hooks associated with a statically linked component in QOF
files. 
<li>Do any necessary restores, and any start up hooks associated
with the restored files. 
</ul>

   <p>The built-in function <code>QP_initialize()</code> takes care of these tasks. 
An example of a user-supplied <code>main()</code> can be found in the reference page
for <code>QP_initialize()</code>.

   <p>The QP_* functions require that Prolog be initialized for memory
management, etc.  Thus, whenever <code>main()</code> is redefined, it will be
necessary to call <code>QP_initialize()</code>.  There is no harm in calling this
routine more than once. 
So people writing portions of large projects can safely
assume Prolog isn't initialized, and call <code>QP_initialize()</code>.
