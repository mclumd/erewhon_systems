<h4 class="subsection">When Source Linking Is Not Possible</h4>

   <p>Sometimes the debugger cannot find the source code for a predicate. 
This will happen when there is no source code, or when the
correspondence between the compiled code and source code cannot be
determined.  For example, a dynamic predicate does not necessarily
have source code, and so the debugger currently cannot show source. 
Similarly, a meta-call (executing a term with <code>call/1</code>) does not
have any source code.  The debugger also often cannot find the source
code of clauses produced by <code>term_expansion/2</code>. Predicates that are
compiled from <code>user</code> do not have source either!

   <p>When source linking is not possible, the debugger will show as much of
the clause as it knows in place of the source file, with the appropriate
arrows.  At a head port, it will show the goal being called, followed by
<code>:- ...</code> indicating that this goal will be matched with the head
of a clause.  For the head of a predicate <code>descendent/2</code>, it might look
like this:

<pre class="example">                         ===&gt; dynamic_pred(_743) :- ...
     </pre>

   <p>At a call port whose source code cannot be shown, the debugger will
show <code>... :-</code> followed by the goal, indicating that this goal is
in some unknown clause.  The arrow will be as appropriate for that
port.  The call port for a call to <code>descendant/2</code> might look like this:

<pre class="example">                         ... :- ---&gt; descendant(peter, _749).
     </pre>
