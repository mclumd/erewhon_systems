</ul>

   <p>There are two sorts of objects that Prolog may want to handle:
<dfn>atomic</dfn> and <dfn>compound</dfn>.  <dfn>Atomic</dfn> objects include numbers and
atoms, and <dfn>compound</dfn> objects include data structures and arrays. 
To be more precise about it, an atomic type is defined by one of the
following.  A long integer is 64 bits on DEC Alpha platforms and 32
bits on other Quintus Prolog platforms.  Long integers are however truncated to 32
bits (sign-extended) by the Prolog system:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>long</code>
     <dd>long signed integer (but see above)

     <br><dt><code>integer</code>
     <dd>32 bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>short</code>
     <dd>16 bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>char</code>
     <dd>8 bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_long</code>
     <dd>long unsigned integer (but see above)

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_integer</code>
     <dd>32 bit unsigned integer (but Prolog can only handle 31 bits unsigned)

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_short</code>
     <dd>16 bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_char</code>
     <dd>8 bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>float</code>
     <dd>32 bit floating-point number

     <br><dt><code>double</code>
     <dd>64 bit floating-point number

     <br><dt><code>atom</code>
     <dd>32 bit Prolog atom number.  Unique for different atoms, but not
consistent across Prolog sessions.

     <br><dt><code>string</code>
     <dd>long pointer to 0-terminated character array.  Represented as an atom in Prolog.

     <br><dt><code>address</code>
     <dd>an untyped address.  Like <code>pointer(_)</code>, but <code>structs</code>
does no type checking for you. Represented as a Prolog integer.

     <br><dt><code>opaque</code>
     <dd>Unknown type.  Cannot be represented in Prolog.  A pointer to
an opaque object may be manipulated. 
</dl>

   <p>And compound types are defined by one of:
     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>pointer</code><var>(Type)</var><code></code>
     <dd>a long pointer to a thing of type <var>Type</var>.

     <br><dt><code>array</code><var>(Num,Type)</var><code></code>
     <dd>A chunk of memory holding <var>Num</var> (an
integer) things of type <var>Type</var>.

     <br><dt><code>array(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>A chunk of memory holding some number of things of
type <var>Type</var>.  This type does not allow bounds checking, so it
should be used with great care.  It is also not possible to use this
sort of array as an element in an array, or in a struct or union.

     <br><dt><code>struct(</code><var>Fields</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>A compound structure.  <var>Fields</var> is a list
of <var>Field</var>_name:<var>Type</var> pairs.  Each <var>Field</var>_name is an
atom, and each <var>Type</var> is any valid type.

     <br><dt><code>union(</code><var>Members</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>A union as in C.  <var>Members</var> is a list of
<var>Member</var>_name:<var>Type</var> pairs. Each <var>Member</var>_name is an
atom, and each <var>Type</var> is any valid type.  The space allocated for
one of these is the maximum of the spaces needed for each member.  It
is not permitted to store into a union (you must get a member of the
union to store into, as in C). 
</dl>

   <p>C programmers will recognize that the kinds of data supported by
this package were designed for the C language.  They should also
work for other languages, but programmers must determine the proper
type declarations in those languages.  The table above makes clear
the storage requirements and interpretation of each type.

   <p>Note that there is one important difference between the <code>structs</code> package
and C:  the <code>structs</code> package permits declarations of pointers to arrays. 
A pointer to an array is distinguished from a pointer to a single
element.  For example
<pre class="example">             pointer(array(char))
     </pre>

   <p>is probably a more appropriate declaration of a C string type than
<pre class="example">             pointer(char)
     </pre>

   <p>which is the orthodox way to declare a string in C.  Note that the
<code>structs_to_c</code> tool described below does generate proper (identical)
C declarations for both of these <code>structs</code> declarations.
