<h4 class="subsection">The client/server relationship</h4>

   <p>Two processes have a client/server relationship when they cooperate
with one another in such a way that one process responds to connection
requests generated by the other.

   <p>It is important to remember that the client/server relationship has a
very restricted meaning: it refers solely to how connections are
established.  For example, an X-Windows server controls the X-Windows
client, whereas a NFS server is controlled by NFS clients.  So saying
processes have a client/server relationship says nothing about which
process is the controlling process.

   <p>The distinction between clients and servers is based solely on how
connections are established.  Servers get connections by accepting
connection requests, clients get connections by requesting a connection
from a server.

     <dl>

     <br><dt>server
     <dd>a process that accepts connection requests. The server is
said to listen for connections.

     <br><dt>client
     <dd>a process that requests a connection from a server.

   </dl>

   <p>A process can be a client to some processes, but a server to other
processes.  In the preceding example, the filter is a server to the
producer and a client of the consumer.

   <p>A Prolog server is a Prolog process that calls the predicate
<code>tcp_create_listener/2</code> and then accepts connection requests. 
A C server is a process that calls the C function
<code>tcp_create_listener()</code> and then accepts connection requests.

   <p>A Prolog client is a Prolog process that calls the
predicate <code>tcp_connect/2</code> to generate connection requests.  In
the same way a C client is a process that calls <code>tcp_connect()</code>.

   <p>Although designed principally with Prolog to Prolog communication in
mind, this package can be used for any combination of C or Prolog
servers or clients.
