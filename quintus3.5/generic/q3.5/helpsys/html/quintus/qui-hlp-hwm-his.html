<h5 class="subsubsection"><b>History</b> Pulldown</h5>

   <p>This pulldown contains a dynamic list of buttons, which represent the
menus and text that have already been displayed in the help window. 
Initially this history list is empty.  As each new section is
displayed, the section that it replaces is placed at the top of this
list.  If a section that is already in the history list is
redisplayed, it is not added to the list a second time.  The list
contains 10 buttons by default.  The number of buttons it contains can
be modified through the resource file (see <a href="qui-ciq.html#qui-ciq">qui-ciq</a>).  When
more than 10 (or whatever other number of buttons you have specified
in the resource file) sections have been viewed, the oldest section is
removed from the history list.  Each history entry that refers to a
menu generated from index entry matches is indicated as such so that
there is no ambiguity between it and a section entry with the same
name.  When you select an element from the history list, that section
is displayed and the history list is not changed.  When you quit the
help window, the history list is cleared.
