<h5 class="subsubsection">Events that come in <dfn>pairs</dfn> selected by a single mask</h5>

   <p>In this case, when selecting the event, you get a complementary pair
automatically. In other words, if you are interested in one of them,
you probably are interested (or should be) in the other too.

   <p><b>Focus In and Focus Out events.</b>
Both of these events are selected internally with a single mask,
<code>focus_change</code>, so even if you register a callback for only one,
your window will also get the other one. You should always register
a callback for both.

   <p>The server generates a <code>focus_in</code> event when the keyboard focus
window changes as a result of an explicit <code>set_input_focus</code>
call. The window that receives this event has the keyboard focus and will
be receiving all keyboard input until it loses the focus. 
Specify with:
<pre class="example">     focus_in
     </pre>

   <p>The server generates a <code>focus_out</code> event when the keyboard focus
window changes as a result of an explicit <code>set_input_focus</code> call. The
window that receives this event has lost the keyboard focus and therefore
will not be receiving any more keyboard input. 
Specify with:
<pre class="example">     focus_out
     </pre>

   <p><b>Graphics Events.</b>
These events present a special problem, as they are not selected
by the window's <code>event_mask</code> attribute, but by the GC
<code>graphics_exposure</code>. Also, they apply to both Windows and Pixmaps.

   <p>These callbacks are <b>not</b> part of the of the
Window, Pixmap or GC attributes
. They are established and de-established dynamically
as an optional parameter to the <code>copy_area</code> and <code>copy_plane</code>
calls.

   <p>The <code>graphics_expose</code> event is generated by
<code>copy_area</code> or <code>copy_plane</code>
when the source area is not available because the region is clipped
or obscured. Specify with
<pre class="example">     graphics_expose
     </pre>

   <p>The server generates a <code>no_expose</code> event when the source
area for a <code>copy_area</code> or <code>copy_plane</code> request was completely
available, and therefore the request was carried out successfully. 
Specify with:
<pre class="example">     no_expose
     </pre>
