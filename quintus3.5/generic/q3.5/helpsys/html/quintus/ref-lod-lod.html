<h4 class="subsection">The Load Predicates</h4>

   <p>Loading a program is accomplished by one of these predicates
     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>load_files(</code><var>File</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>compiles source file or loads QOF file,
whichever is the more recent.  <code>load_files(</code><var>File</var><code>)</code> can also be
written as <code>[</code><var>File</var><code>]</code>.

     <br><dt><code>compile(</code><var>File</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>compiles source file.

     <br><dt><code>consult(</code><var>File</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>Same as <code>compile</code>

     <br><dt><code>ensure_loaded(</code><var>File</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>loads more recent of source and QOF files,
unless the file has already been loaded and it has not been modified since it
was loaded.

     <br><dt><code>load_files(</code><var>File</var><code>, </code><var>Options</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>loads file according to the specified
options.  All the above predicates can be regarded as special cases of this
one.

     <br><dt><code>reconsult(</code><var>Files</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>same as <code>consult</code>
</dl>

   <p>The following notes apply to all the Load Predicates:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>The <var>File</var> argument must be one of:
          <ul>

          <li>an atom that is the name of a file containing Prolog code; a <code>.pl</code> or a
<code>.qof</code> suffix to a filename may be omitted (see <a href="ref-fdi-fsp-fde.html#ref-fdi-fsp-fde">ref-fdi-fsp-fde</a>;)
<li>a list of any atom listed above;
<li>the atom <code>user</code>
</ul>

     <blockquote>

          <p><strong>Please note:</strong> If the filename is
not a valid atom, it must be enclosed in single quotes.  For
example,

          <pre class="example">               load_files(expert)
               load_files('Expert')
               compile('/usr/joe/expert')
               ensure_loaded('expert.pl')
               </pre>

     </blockquote>

     <li>These predicates resolve relative file names in the same way as
<code>absolute_file_name/2</code>.  For information on file names refer
to <a href="ref-fdi.html#ref-fdi">ref-fdi</a>.

     <li>The above predicates raise an exception if any of the files named in
<var>File</var> does not exist, unless the <code>fileerrors</code> flag is set to <code>off</code> using <code>nofileerrors/0</code>.

     <p>Errors detected during compilation, such as an attempt to redefine a built-in
predicate, also cause exceptions to be raised.  However, these exceptions are
caught by the compiler, and an appropriate error message is printed. 
</p><li>There are a number of <dfn>style warnings</dfn> that may appear when a file is
compiled.  These are designed to aid in catching simple errors in your
programs, but some or all of them can be turned off if desired using <code>no_style_check/1</code>.  The possible
style warnings are:
          <ol type=a start=1>

          <li>A named variable occurs only once in a clause.  Variables beginning with
a <code>_</code> are considered not named. 
<li>All the clauses for a predicate are not adjacent to one another in the file. 
<li>A predicate is being redefined in a file different from the one in which it
was previously defined.
          </ol>

     <li>By default, all clauses for a predicate are required to come from just
one file.  A predicate must be declared <code>multifile</code> if its clauses
are to be spread across several different files.  See the reference
page for <code>multifile/1</code>. 
<li>If a file being loaded is not a module-file, all the predicates
defined in the file are loaded into the source module.  The form
<code>load_files(Module:File)</code> can be used to load the file into the
specified module.  See <a href="ref-mod-def.html#ref-mod-def">ref-mod-def</a>, for information about
module-files.  If a file being loaded <em>is</em> a module-file, it is
first loaded in the normal way, then the source module imports all the
public predicates of the module-file except for <code>use_module</code> and
<code>load_file</code> if you specify an import list. 
<li>If there are any directives in the file being loaded, that
is, any terms with principal functor <code>:-/1</code> or <code>?-/1</code>, then
these are executed as they are encountered.  A common type of
directive to have in a file is one that loads another
file, such as
     <pre class="example">           :- [otherfile].
          </pre>
      In this case, if otherfile is a
relative filename it is resolved with respect to the directory
containing the file that is being loaded, not the current working
directory of the Prolog system.

     <p>Any legal Prolog goal may be included as a directive. Note, however,
that if the file is compiled by <code>qpc</code>, the goal will be executed by <code>qpc</code>,
not when the <code>.qof</code> file is loaded or when application begins execution. 
The <code>initialization/1</code> declaration provides this functionality. 
There is no difference between a <code>:-/1</code> and a <code>?-/1</code>
goal in a file being compiled.

     </p><li>If <var>File</var> is the atom <code>user</code>, or <var>File</var> is a list, and
during loading of the list <code>user</code> is encountered, procedures are to
be typed directly into Prolog from the terminal.  A special prompt,
<code>| </code>, is displayed at the beginning of every new clause entered
from the terminal.  Continuation lines of clauses typed at the
terminal are preceded by a prompt of five spaces.  When all clauses
have been typed in, the last should be followed by an end-of-file
character. 
<li>Terms that are notational variants
of Prolog terms, notably grammar terms, are expanded into Prolog code
during compilation.  By defining the hook predicate
<code>term_expansion/2</code> (in module user), you can specify any desired
transformation to be done as clauses are loaded.

     <li>Any predicates that need to be called during the compilation of a
file, including <code>term_expansion/2</code> and all the predicates it calls,
must be treated specially if you wish to be able to compile that file
with <code>qpc</code>. See <a href="sap-srs-eci-crt.html#sap-srs-eci-crt">sap-srs-eci-crt</a> for information on this. 
<li>The current load context (module, file, stream, directory) can be
queried using <code>prolog_load_context/2</code>.
        </ol>
