<h4 class="subsection">Specifying a Term Class Essence</h4>

   <p>As mentioned above, it is possible to specify a term class as the type of a slot of some
other object.  For example, we might declare

<pre class="example">     :- class colored_rectangle = [
             public origin:point,
             public size:size,
             public color:rgb_color].
     </pre>

   <p>This will store an <code>rgb_color</code> object (i.e., a <code>color/3</code> term) in
the <code>color</code> slot of each <code>colored_rectangle</code> object. 
Unfortunately, though, Quintus Objects cannot tell what is the best
way to store a term object, and therefore it stores it the same way it
stores a slot declared to be of <code>term</code> type: using the Prolog
database.  This has all the efficiency disadvantages of <code>term</code>
slots.  In this
case, however, we know that all that really needs to be saved in order
to save an <code>rgb_color</code> object is the three arguments.  We also know
that each of these arguments is a floating point number, and because
precision isn't terribly critical in representating colors, each of
these numbers can be stored as a <code>float</code>, rather than a <code>double</code>. 
In effect, we know that the <em>essence</em> of a <code>rgb_color</code> object is
these three numbers; if we have them, we can easily construct the
<code>color/3</code> term.  If we provide this information in the declaration
of the <code>rgb_color</code> class, then Quintus Objects can store instances of
the <code>rgb_color</code> class as 3 separate floats, rather than as a term,
significantly improving the performance of creating or destroying a
<code>colored_rectangle</code> object, as well as accessing or modifying its
<code>color</code> slot.

   <p>The essence of a term class is specified with the following form of
<code>class</code> declaration:
<pre class="example">     :- class <var>ClassName</var> = term(<var>Term</var>, <var>Constraint</var>, <var>Essence</var>).
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>Essence</var> is of the form
<pre class="example">     [<var>Name1</var>:<var>Type1</var>=i[Variable1], <var>Name2</var>:<var>Type2</var>=i[Variable2], ...]
     </pre>

   <p>and each <var>Name</var> is a distinct atom naming a slot, each
<var>Type</var> is a slot type as specified in <a href="obj-scl-slt-typ.html#obj-scl-slt-typ">obj-scl-slt-typ</a>, and each
<var>Variable</var> is an unbound variable appering in <var>Term</var>. 
Providing a term essence not only makes storage of terms in ordinary
object slots more efficient, it also gives a name to each
"essential" slot of the term class.  This allows you to use
<code>fetch_slot</code> to fetch the slots of this class.

   <p>To extend our <code>rgb_color</code> example, we might introduce the <code>rgb_color</code>
class with this declaration:
<pre class="example">     :- class rgb_color =
              term(color(Red,Green,Blue),
                   (float(Red),   Red &gt;= 0.0,   Red =&lt; 1.0,
                    float(Green), Green &gt;= 0.0, Green =&lt; 1.0,
                    float(Blue),  Blue &gt;= 0.0,  Blue =&lt; 1.0),
                   [red:float=Red, green:float=Green, blue:float=Blue]).
     </pre>

   <p>This declaration defines the <code>rgb_color</code> class exactly as the
example declaration of the previous section: every <code>color/3</code> term
whose arguments are all floating point numbers between 0.0 and 1.0
inclusive are instances of <code>rgb_color</code>.  The difference is that with
this declaration, ordinary classes that have slots of type
<code>rgb_color</code>, such as the <code>colored_rectangle</code> example above,
will be stored more efficiently, and their <code>rgb_color</code>
slots will be accessed and modified much more efficiently. 
Also, it will be possible to use <code>fetch_slot(red, Red)</code> in the
methods of the <code>rgb_color</code> class to fetch to red component of the
message recipient, and similarly for <code>green</code> and <code>blue</code>.
