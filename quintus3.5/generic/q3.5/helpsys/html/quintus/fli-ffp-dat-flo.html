<h5 class="subsubsection">Passing Floats</h5>

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +float
     C:       double x;
     </pre>

   <p>The C double-precision float is converted to a Prolog float,
   which is passed to the Prolog call.  If the C double contains garbage,
   Prolog will receive that garbage as a double-precision floating-point
   number.  Many C compilers will allow the parameter declaration to
   be <code>float</code> instead of <code>double</code> because they always convert
   single-precision floating-point arguments to double-precision. 
   However, C compilers conforming to the new ANSI standard will not
   do this, so it is recommended that <code>double</code> be used.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +single
     ANSI C:  float x;
     </pre>

   <p>The C single-precision float is converted to a Prolog float,
   which is passed to the Prolog call.  If the C float contains garbage,
   Prolog will receive that garbage as a single-precision floating-point
   number.

   <p>Normally, this type of argument is not used; however, C
   compilers conforming to the new ANSI standard can pass single
   precision floats to Prolog
   without first converting them to double.  It is not recommended
   that floats be passed as <code>single</code> until you have verified that
   your C compiler behaves as desired.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +double
     C:       double x;
     </pre>

   <p>The C double-precision float is converted to a Prolog float,
   which is passed to the Prolog call.  If the C float contains garbage,
   Prolog will receive that garbage as a double-precision floating-point
   number.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -float
     C:       float *x;
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a C float is passed to the foreign interface. 
   When Prolog returns a solution, a Prolog floating-point number is
   expected in the
   corresponding argument of the call.  The foreign interface converts
   that number into a C float and writes it at the location supplied. 
   The previous contents of the location are destroyed.  If the
   Prolog call does not return a floating-point number in the appropriate
   position, a type error is raised and the contents of the location
   is unchanged.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -single
     C:       float *x;
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a C float is passed to the foreign interface. 
   When Prolog returns a solution, a Prolog floating-point number is
   expected in the
   corresponding argument of the call.  The foreign interface converts
   that number into a C float and writes it at the location supplied. 
   The previous contents of the location are destroyed.  If the
   Prolog call does not return a floating-point number in the appropriate
   position, a type error is raised and the contents of the location
   is unchanged.

   <p>When the foreign language calling Prolog is C, this type of
   argument is not normally used; however, C compilers conforming
   to the new ANSI standard can return single precision floats from
   Prolog without first converting them to double.  It is not
   recommended that floats be passed as <code>single</code> until you have
   verified that your C compiler behaves as desired.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -double
     C:       double *x;
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a C double is passed to the foreign interface. 
   When Prolog returns a solution, a Prolog floating-point number is
   expected in the corresponding argument of the call.  The foreign
   interface converts that number into a C double and writes it at
   the location supplied.  The previous contents of the location will
   be destroyed.  If the Prolog call does not return a floating-point
   number in the appropriate position, a type error is signaled and the
   contents of the location is unchanged.

   <p>It is assumed that the interface will overwrite this float with
   Prolog's result.  When Prolog returns, its floating-point number
   is converted to double-precision and written onto the space
   for the foreign double.  The previous contents of the C double
   will be lost.  If the Prolog call does not return a floating-point
   number, a type error is raised and the result is unchanged.
