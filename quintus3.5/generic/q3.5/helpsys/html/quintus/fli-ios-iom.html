<h4 class="subsection">Input/Output Model</h4>

   <p>There are three layers of input/output operations visible in the Prolog
system as illustrated in the figure "Input/Output Model".

   <p>The <dfn>top layer</dfn> is character based. 
It supports reading a character, writing a character
and testing the state of a Prolog stream.  <code>get0/[1,2]</code> and
<code>put/[1,2]</code> are examples of the first layer operation.

   <p>The <dfn>middle layer</dfn> is record based.  Its primary function is to keep the
integrity of a record, through such operations as trimming a record,
padding a record and handling output overflow.  This layer is not
visible to the user and cannot be changed by the user.

   <p>The <dfn>bottom layer</dfn> is buffer based.  It performs the actual input from
or output to the underlying device of a Prolog stream. The bottom layer
is a collection of five functions associated with a stream:
read, write, flush, seek and close functions. 
Typically the read function reads data from the underlying device into
a buffer that it maintains and then passes this data up to the middle
layer a record at a time. The write function provides buffer space for
a record to be received from the middle layer and writes out the buffer
to the underlying device.

   <p>The embedding open function <code>QU_open()</code> assigns the appropriate
bottom layer functions for a stream created by <code>open/[3,4]</code>. 
A user-defined Prolog stream must supply its own bottom layer functions
for the stream. 
Bottom layer functions are described in <a href="fli-ios-bot.html#fli-ios-bot">fli-ios-bot</a>.

   <p>Writing to a <code>QP_DELIM_LF</code> record
file stream demonstrates how the three layers work together. 
Each <code>put/2</code> call on the stream simply stores a character
in the record buffer of the stream. 
When the top layer predicate, <code>nl/1</code>, is called on the stream, the middle layer output function is
called. 
The middle layer function stores a &lt;LFD&gt; in the record buffer
and updates some counters for the stream.  It then calls the bottom layer
function of the stream.  The bottom layer writes out the record to the output
file.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong> In addition, the top layer contains predicates and C functions
to perform seek, flush output and close operations on a stream. 
There are no middle layer functions for these operations.
