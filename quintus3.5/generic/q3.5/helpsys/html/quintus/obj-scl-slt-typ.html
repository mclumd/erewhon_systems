<h5 class="subsubsection">Types</h5>

   <p>A slot's type restricts the kinds of values it may contain. The slot
is specified in the slot description by one of the following Prolog
terms with the corresponding meaning.  Most of these will be
familiar, but the last four, <code>address</code>, <code>term</code>, <var>Class</var> and
<code>pointer(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>, require some additional explanation:

     <dl>

     <br><dt><b>Type</b>
     <dd><b>Description</b>

     <br><dt><code>integer</code>
     <dd>32-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>short</code>
     <dd>16-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>char</code>
     <dd>8-bit signed integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_short</code>
     <dd>16-bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>unsigned_char</code>
     <dd>8-bit unsigned integer

     <br><dt><code>float</code>
     <dd>32-bit floating point number

     <br><dt><code>double</code>
     <dd>64-bit floating point number

     <br><dt><code>atom</code>
     <dd>Prolog atom (32-bit pointer)

     <br><dt><code>address</code>
     <dd>32-bit address

     <p>The address type is intended for use with foreign code. 
A slot of this type might store an address returned from
a foreign function. That address might, in turn, be used
in calling another foreign function or with the
<code>assign/2</code> predicate or with arithmetic operators such
as <code>integer_at</code>. Hence, most Prolog programmers can
safely ignore this type.

     <br><dt><code>term</code>
     <dd>Prolog term

     <p>The term type is for general Prolog terms. Such a slot
can hold any of the other types. However, if you know
a slot will be used to hold only values of a particular
type, it is more efficient to specify that type in the class
definition.

     <p>Storing a term containing free variables is similar to
asserting a clause containing free variables into the
Prolog database. The free variables in the term are replaced
with new variables in the stored copy. And, when you
fetch the term from the slot, you are really fetching a
copy of the term, again with new variables.

     <br><dt><var>Class</var>
     <dd>where <var>Class</var> is the name of a defined class

     <p>The class type is for any object in a class defined with
Quintus Objects. Such a slot holds an object of its class
or one of that class's descendants, or the <code>null</code> object (see
<a href="obj-scl-slt-null.html#obj-scl-slt-null">obj-scl-slt-null</a>).

     <br><dt><code>pointer(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>where <var>Type</var> is an atom

     <p>The pointer type is intended for use with the Structs Package, ProXT
or ProXL.  It is similar to the <code>address</code> type, except that access to this
slot yields, and update to this slot expects, a term of arity 1 whose
functor is Type and whose argument is the address. Again, most Prolog
programmers can safely ignore this type. 
</dl>

   <p>Please note that there is no <code>unsigned_int</code> or <code>unsigned_long</code>
type, because Prolog itself currently cannot represent such a number. 
You should represent such numbers as type <code>integer</code> with care. 
Arithmetic operations on unsigned integers represented this way will
work as expected, however comparisons will not!  This is inherent in
using Prolog to manipulate 32 bit unsigned numbers in general; it is
not specific to Quintus Objects.
