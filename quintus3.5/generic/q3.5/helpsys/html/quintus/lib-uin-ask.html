<h4 class="subsection">Yes-no Questions, and Others -- <code>library(ask)</code></h4>

   <p>The file <code>library(ask)</code> defines a set of commands for asking questions
whose answer is a single character, and for asking for file names
(see <a href="lib-ofi-oth-ask.html#lib-ofi-oth-ask">lib-ofi-oth-ask</a>).

   <p><code>library(ask)</code> uses several commands from <code>library(prompt)</code>,
but if you want to use them in your program you should
explicitly include the directive
<pre class="example">     :- ensure_loaded(library(prompt)).
     </pre>

   <p>in your program.  The principal such command is <code>prompt/1</code>, which
is used to print the question or prompt.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>yesno(</code><var>+Question</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes <var>Question</var> (using <code>write/1</code>) to the terminal, regardless of
the current output stream, and reads an answer. 
The prompt is followed by <code>? </code>, so you should not put a question
mark in the question yourself.  The answer
is the first character typed in response; anything following on the
same line will be thrown away.  If the answer is <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>Y</kbd>, <code>yesno/1</code>
succeeds.  If the answer is <kbd>n</kbd> or <kbd>N</kbd>, <code>yesno/1</code> fails.  Otherwise it
repeats the question.  The user has to explicitly type a <kbd>y</kbd> or <kbd>n</kbd>
before it will stop.  Because the rest of the line is thrown
away, the user can type <kbd>yes</kbd>, <kbd>Yes</kbd>, <kbd>You'd better not</kbd>, and so
forth with exactly the same effect as a plain <kbd>y</kbd>.  If the user
just presses &lt;RET&gt;, that is <em>not</em> taken as <kbd>yes</kbd>.

     <br><dt><code>yesno(</code><var>+Question</var><code>, </code><var>+Default</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
is like <code>yesno/1</code> except that
          <ul>

          <li><var>Default</var> may be an atom
(the first character of whose name will be used), a string (whose
first character will be used) or an ASCII code, and will be written
in brackets before the question mark; and
<li>if the user just presses &lt;RET&gt;,  <var>Default</var> will be used as the answer. 
</ul>

     <p>For example,
     <pre class="example">          yesno('Do you want an extended trace', yes)
          </pre>

     <p>prints
     <pre class="example">          Do you want an extended trace [y]? _
          </pre>

     <p>and leaves the terminal's cursor where the underscore is.  If the
user presses &lt;RET&gt;, this call to <code>yesno/1</code> will succeed. 
If the user answers <kbd>yes</kbd> it will succeed.  If the user answers
<kbd>no</kbd> it will fail.      If the first non-layout character of the user's answer
is neither <kbd>n</kbd>, <kbd>N</kbd>, <kbd>y</kbd>, nor <kbd>Y</kbd>, the question will be
repeated.

     <br><dt><code>ask(</code><var>+Question</var><code>, </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes <var>Question</var> to the terminal as <code>yesno/1</code> would, and
reads a single character <var>Answer</var>.  <var>Answer</var> must be a "graphic"
character (a printing character other than space).  <code>ask/2</code> will
continue asking until it is given such a character.  The remainder
of the input line will be thrown away.

     <br><dt><code>ask(</code><var>+Question</var><code>, </code><var>+Default</var><code>, </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
uses <var>Default</var> as the default character the way that <code>yesno/2</code> does,
and mentions the default in brackets just before the question
mark.  If the user presses carriage return,  <var>Default</var> will be
returned as his <var>Answer</var>.  <var>Answer</var> can be instantiated, in which
case the call to <code>ask/2</code> or <code>ask/3</code> will fail if the user does not
give that answer.  For example, <code>yesno/2</code> could (almost) have been
defined as
     <pre class="example">          yesno(Question, Default) :-
                  ask(Question, Default, 0'y).
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>ask_chars(</code><var>+Prompt</var><code>, </code><var>+MinLength</var><code>, </code><var>+MaxLength</var><code>, </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes <var>Prompt</var> to the terminal, and reads a line of characters from it. 
This response must contain between <var>MinLength</var> and <var>MaxLength</var>
characters inclusive, otherwise the question will be repeated until an
answer of satisfactory length is obtained. 
Leading and/or trailing layout characters are retained in the result,
and are counted when determining the length of the answer. 
The list of character codes read is unified with <var>Answer</var>. 
Note that a colon and a space (<code>: </code>) are added to the Prompt,
so don't add such punctuation yourself. 
The end-user can find out what sort of input is required by typing
a line that starts with a question mark.  Therefore it is not possible
to read such a line as data.  See <code>prompted_line/2</code> in <code>library(prompt)</code>.

     <p>Examples:
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ask_chars('Label', 1, 8, Answer).</kbd>
          Label: <kbd>213456789</kbd>
          Please enter between 1 and 8 characters.
          Do not add a full stop unless it is part of the answer.
          Label: <kbd>four</kbd>
          
          Answer = "four"
          
          | ?- <kbd>ask_chars('Heading', 1, 30, Answer).</kbd>
          Heading: <kbd>?</kbd>
          Please enter between 1 and 30 characters.
          Do not add a full stop unless it is part of the answer.
          Heading: <kbd>   three leading spaces</kbd>
          
          Answer = "   three leading spaces"
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>ask_number(</code><var>+Prompt, +Default, -Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes <var>Prompt</var> on the terminal, and reads a line from it in response. 
If, after "garbage" characters are thrown away, the line read represents
a Prolog number, that number is unified with <var>Answer</var>. 
The "garbage" characters that are thrown away are layout characters
(including spaces and tabs), underscores <code>_</code>, and plus signs <code>+</code>. 
For example, the input <code>+ 123_456</code> would be treated as if the
user had typed <code>123456</code>.  The conversion is done by <code>number_chars/2</code>. 
If the user entered an integer, <var>Answer</var> will be unified with an
integer.  If the user entered a floating-point number, <var>Answer</var> will
be unified with a floating-point number.  No conversion is done. 
If the line contains only "garbage" characters and there is a
<var>Default</var> argument, <var>Answer</var> is unified with <var>Default</var>. 
This happens regardless of whether or not <var>Default</var> is a number. 
If the input is unacceptable, the question will be repeated after
an explanation of what is expected.  The user can type <kbd>?</kbd> for help. 
Examples:
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ask_number('Pick a number', X).</kbd>
          Pick a number: <kbd>?</kbd>
          Please enter a number followed by RETURN
          Pick a number: <kbd>27</kbd>
          
          X = 27
          
          | ?- <kbd>ask_number('Say cheese', X).</kbd>
          Say cheese:
          Please enter a number followed by RETURN
          Say cheese: <kbd>3 . 141 _ 593</kbd>
          
          X = 3.14159
          
          | ?- <kbd>ask_number('Your guess', '100%', X).</kbd>
          Your guess [100%]: <kbd>38.</kbd>
          Please enter a number followed by RETURN
          Your guess [100%]: <kbd>38</kbd>
          
          X = 38
          
          | ?- <kbd>ask_number('Your guess', '100%', X).</kbd>
          Your guess [100%]: <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
          
          X = '100%'
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>ask_number(</code><var>+Prompt</var><code>, </code><var>+Lower</var><code>, </code><var>+Upper</var><code>[, </code><var>+Default</var><code>], </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
These two predicates are a combination of <code>ask_between/[4,5]</code> and
<code>ask_number/[2,3]</code>.  They write the prompt to the terminal, read a line from
it in response, throw away "garbage" characters, try to parse the result
as a number, and check that it is between the <var>Lower</var> and <var>Upper</var> bounds. 
<var>Lower</var> and <var>Upper</var> may severally be integers or floating point
numbers.  <var>Answer</var> will be unified with an integer if the user typed
an integer, with a floating-point number if the user typed a floating-point
number, or with whatever <var>Default</var> happens to be if there is a
<var>Default</var> and the user entered an empty line.  If you want a floating-point
result whatever the user typed, you will have to do your own
conversion with <code>is/2</code>. 
Examples:
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ask_number('Enter temperature in Fahrenheit',
                           32.0, 212.0, 77.0, Temp).</kbd>
          Enter temperature in Fahrenheit [77.0]: <kbd>10</kbd>
          Please enter a number between 32.0 and 212.0 followed
          by RETURN
          Enter temperature in Fahrenheit [77.0]: <kbd>68</kbd>
          
          Temp = 68
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>ask_file(</code><var>+Question</var><code>, </code><var>-Filename</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>same as <code>ask_file/3</code>.

     <br><dt><code>ask_file(</code><var>+Question</var><code>, </code><var>+Mode</var><code>, </code><var>-FileName</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes <var>Question</var> to the terminal and reads a filename from the terminal,
regardless of the current I/O streams.  If the user presses &lt;RET&gt;,
<code>ask_file/3</code> just fails; an empty filename is taken as an indication
that the user has finished entering file names.  A reply
beginning with a question mark will cause a brief help message to be
printed (explaining that a filename is wanted, and how to enter one),
and the question will be repeated.  Otherwise, <code>ask_file/3</code> checks that
the file can be opened in the mode specified by <var>Mode</var> (<code>read</code>,
<code>write</code>, or <code>append</code>). 
If it is not possible to open the file in mode <var>Mode</var>,
the operating system's error
result is reported and the question is repeated.  If it is possible
to open the file in this mode, the name of the file is returned
as <var>FileName</var>. 
However, <code>ask_file/3</code> does <em>not</em> open the file for you, it simply checks that
it is <em>possible</em> to open the file.  Here is an example "dialogue":
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ask_file('Where should the cross-reference go? ',
               write, File).</kbd>
          Where should the cross-reference go? <kbd>?</kbd>
          Please enter the name of a file that can be opened
          in write mode, followed by &lt;RET&gt;.  To end this
          operation, just type &lt;RET&gt; with no filename.
          Where should the cross-reference go? <kbd>call.pl</kbd>
          
          ! Permission error: cannot access file 'call.pl'
          ! O/S error : Permission denied
          ! goal:  can_open_file('call.pl',write,warn)
          </pre>

     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ask_file('Where should the cross-reference go? ',
               write, File).</kbd>
          Where should the cross-reference go? <kbd>call.xref</kbd>
          
          File = 'call.xref'
          
          | ?- <kbd>ask_file('Next file: ', read, File).</kbd>
          Next file: <kbd>call.pl</kbd>
          
          ! Permission error: cannot access file 'call.pl'
          ! O/S error : Permission denied
          ! goal:  can_open_file('call.pl',read,warn)
          </pre>

     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ask_file('Next file: ', read, File).</kbd>
          Next file: <kbd>call.xref</kbd>
          
          ! Existence error in can_open_file/3
          ! file call.xref does not exist
          ! O/S error : No such file or directory
          ! goal:  can_open_file('call.xref',read,warn)
          </pre>

     <p>Points to note:
          <ul>

          <li><code>ask_file/3</code> does not add a question mark and space to the prompt; you
must  put them in the question yourself. 
<li>Although the first call
to <code>ask_file/3</code> found that it was <em>possible</em> to open <code>call.xref</code> for output,
it <em>did not</em> open it, so the second call to <code>ask_file/3</code> could not find any
such file. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><code>ask_between(</code><var>+Prompt</var><code>, </code><var>+Lower</var><code>, </code><var>+Upper</var><code>[, </code><var>+Default</var><code>], </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>
writes <var>Prompt</var> on the terminal, and reads a line in response.  If
the line read represents a Prolog integer between <var>Lower</var> and <var>Upper</var>
inclusive, this line
is unified with <var>Answer</var>.  The line may contain only digits and perhaps
a leading minus sign.  If the line is empty and there is a <var>Default</var>
argument, <var>Answer</var> is unified with <var>Default</var>.  This happens regardless of
whether <var>Default</var> is an integer or in the indicated range.  If the answer
read is not acceptable, the user is told what sort of answer is wanted and
is prompted again.  For example, after defining
     <pre class="example">          p(X) :-
             ask_between('Number of samples',1,20,
                          [none],X),
             integer(X).
          </pre>

     <p>the following conversation might take place.
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>p(X).</kbd>
          Number of samples [none]: <kbd>?</kbd>
          Please enter an integer between 1 and 20
          Do not add a full stop.
          Number of samples [none]: <kbd>0</kbd>
          Please enter an integer between 1 and 20
          Do not add a full stop.
          Number of samples [none]: <kbd>9</kbd>
          
          X = 9
          
          | ?- <kbd>p(X).</kbd>
          Number of samples [none]: <kbd>&lt;RET&gt;</kbd>
          no
          </pre>

     <p>The prompt that is printed is <code></code><var>Prompt</var><code> [</code><var>Default</var><code>]: </code> if
there is a <var>Default</var>
argument, <code></code><var>Prompt</var><code>: </code> otherwise, so that you can use the same prompt
whether or not there is a default argument.

     <br><dt><code>ask_oneof(</code><var>+Prompt</var><code>, </code><var>+Constants</var><code>[, </code><var>+Default</var><code>], </code><var>-Answer</var><code>)</code>
     <dd>

     <p>prints <var>Prompt</var> on the terminal, and reads a line in response. 
<var>Constants</var>
should be a list of constants (terms that are acceptable as the first
argument of <code>name/2</code>).  If the user's response is the full name of one
of the
constants, <var>Answer</var> is unified with that constant.  Failing that, if the
user's response is a prefix of exactly one of the constants, <var>Answer</var> is
unified with that constant.  If the response is just &lt;RET&gt;,
and there is
a <var>Default</var> argument, <var>Answer</var> is unified with <var>Default</var> (which need
not be a
constant, nor need it be an element of <var>Constants</var>).  If nothing else works,
the user is told what sort of response is wanted, and is prompted again.

     <p>The prompt that is printed is <code></code><var>Prompt</var><code> [</code><var>Default</var><code>]: </code> if there
is a <var>Default</var>
argument, <code></code><var>Prompt</var><code>: </code> otherwise, so that you can use the same prompt
whether or not there is a default argument. 
</dl>

   <p>You should find it straightforward to define your own simple queries using
this kit.  As a general rule, try to arrange things so that if the user
types a question mark s/he is told what sort of response is wanted.  All
the queries defined in this section do that.

   <p>The commands for reading English sentences do nothing special
when their input is a single question mark.  Here is an example of how
you can build a query from them that does something sensible in this
case.
<pre class="example">     ask_sentence(Prompt, Sentence) :-
         repeat,
             prompt(Prompt),
             read_in(X),
             (   X = [?] -&gt;
                 format(user_output,
                     'Please enter an English sentence.~n', []),
                 fail
             ;   true
             ),
         !,
         Sentence = X.
