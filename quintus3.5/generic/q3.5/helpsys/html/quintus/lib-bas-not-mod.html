<h5 class="subsubsection">Mode Annotations</h5>

   <p>A new system of representing the modes of arguments has been adapted
in Release 3, is described in <a href="mpg.html#mpg">mpg</a>. The
library, including IPC, is still documented under the old system of
mode annotations:

   <p>Each predicate definition is headed by a goal template such as
<pre class="example">     setof(<var>?X</var>,<var>+Goal</var>,<var>-Set</var>)
     </pre>

   <p>Here <var>X</var> and the others are meta-variables, which name the arguments so
that we don't have to keep saying "its first argument" and so on.  The
characters that precede the meta-variables will seem familiar if you know
the mode declarations of DEC-10 Prolog; their significance is as follows:
     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>+</code>
     <dd>This argument is an input to the predicate.  It must initially
be instantiated;
otherwise, the predicate raises an error exception.

     <br><dt><code>-</code>
     <dd>This argument is an output.  It is returned by the predicate. 
That is, the
output value is unified with any value that was supplied for this
argument.  The predicate fails if this unification fails.  If no value
is supplied, the predicate succeeds, and the output variable is unified
with the return value.

     <br><dt><code>?</code>
     <dd>This argument does not fall into either of the above categories.  It
is not necessarily an input nor an output, and it need not be instantiated. 
</dl>

   <p>Note that it is not an error to call a predicate with a <code>-</code> argument already
instantiated.  The value supplied will simply be unified with the result
returned, and if that unification fails, the predicate fails.
