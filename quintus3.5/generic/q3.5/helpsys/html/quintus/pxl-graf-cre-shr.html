<h5 class="subsubsection">Sharing and Cloning of Gcs</h5>

   <p>Internally, each drawable has a gc.  All of the drawing primitives that
allow an optional gc will use this gc when no gc is specified. 
By setting a drawable's gc, it is possible to have several drawables
share a common gc.  Then, by changing this gc, you have changed the
drawing behavior (when no gc is specified in the drawing command) of all
the drawables that share this gc.

   <p>It is important, however, to understand the difference between changing
the graphics attributes of a drawable and changing the graphics
attributes of a gc.  When you change the graphics attributes of a
drawable, if any other drawable shares that gc, then the gc is cloned
before modifying it.  This means that changing the graphics attributes
of a drawable <em>cannot</em> change the graphics attributes of any other
drawable.  However, changing the graphics attributes of a gc <em>will</em>
change the graphics attributes of any drawable that uses that gc.

   <p>In fact, when you create a drawable but don't specify any graphics
attributes, that drawable shares a gc with any other drawables that that
haven't specified any graphics attributes.  But the first time you
specify graphics attributes for that drawable, its gc will be cloned. 
From then on, unless you explicitly give it a gc, its gc will not be
shared, so any changes you make to its graphics attributes will be
entirely private to that drawable.
