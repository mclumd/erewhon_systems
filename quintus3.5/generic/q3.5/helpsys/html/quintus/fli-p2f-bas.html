</ul>

   <p>This section describes how to
load and call programs written in C, Pascal, FORTRAN, or Assembly
language.  This may be desirable in order to:
     <ul>

     <li>combine Prolog with existing programs and libraries, thereby forming
composite systems;
<li>interface with the operating system or other system level programs;
<li>speed up certain critical operations. 
</ul>

   <p>Examples showing the correct use of the foreign interface are
found in the library directory.  Examples of incrementally loading C, Pascal
and FORTRAN code can be found in <a href="fli-p2f-fex.html#fli-p2f-fex">fli-p2f-fex</a>.

   <p>Foreign functions are loaded directly into the
Prolog system by using one of the built-in predicates
<code>load_foreign_executable/1</code> or
<code>load_foreign_files/2</code>. These predicates load executable
images or object files into the address space of the running Prolog.

   <p>Before calling these predicates, you must prepare facts in the
database that describe which functions may be called by Prolog,
the native language of each function, and the argument types of
each function. 
This information is used to link Prolog predicates and foreign functions
when loading the foreign code.

   <p>The foreign language interface supports the direct exchange of
Prolog's atomic data types (atoms, integers and floating-point
numbers).  The data is automatically converted between Prolog's
internal representation and the internal representation of the foreign
language.

   <p>The foreign language interface also supports passing
any Prolog term to C and receiving any Prolog term from C. 
A set of C functions is provided to type test and access
terms passed to C and to create new Prolog terms in C.  For information
on these functions see <a href="cfu.html#cfu">cfu</a>.

   <p>Prolog procedures that are attached to foreign functions are determinate,
in that they
succeed at most once for a given call and are not re-entered
on backtracking. 
This imposes no serious limitation, since it is always possible
to divide  a foreign function
 into the part to be done on the
first call and the part to be redone on backtracking. 
Backtracking can then take place at the Prolog level where it is naturally
expressed.
