<h4 class="subsection">"is-not-provable" vs. "is-not-true" -- <code>not(</code><var>Goal</var><code>)</code></h4>

   <p>If the difference between the Prolog "is-not-provable"  operator (<code>\+</code>) and
the standard negation operator of logic is not taken into account, you
may find
that some of your programs will behave in an unexpected manner. 
Here is an example:

<pre class="example">     man(john).
     man(adam).
     
     woman(sue).
     woman(eve).
     
     married(adam, eve).
     
     married(X) :-
             married(X, _).
     married(X) :-
             married(_, X).
     
     human(X) :-
             man(X).
     human(X) :-
             woman(X).
     </pre>

   <p>The question
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>\+ married(Who).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>is a perfectly good one, to which one might at first glance expect the
response to be <code>john</code> or <code>sue</code>.  However, the meaning of this clause to
Prolog is
<pre class="display">     
     is it the case that the term <code>married(Who)</code> has
     no provable instances?
     </pre>

   <p>to which the answer is <code>no</code>, as <code>married(adam)</code> is an instance of
<code>married(Who)</code> and is provable by Prolog.  The question
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>\+ dead(X).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>is also a perfectly good one, and after perhaps complaining that
<code>dead/1</code> is undefined, Prolog will report the answer <code>yes</code>, because
<code>dead(X)</code> has no instance that can be proven from this database. 
In effect, this means "for all X, <code>dead(X)</code> is not provable".  Even
though "<code>dead(adam)</code> is not provable" is a true consequence of this
statement, Prolog will <em>not</em> report <code>X = adam</code> as a solution of this
question.  This is not the function of <code>\+/1</code>.

   <p>Note also that "<code>dead(adam)</code> is false" is <em>not</em> a valid
consequence of this database, even though "<code>dead(adam)</code> is not provable"
is true.  To deduce one from the other requires the use of
the "Closed World Assumption", which can be paraphrased as "anything that
I do not know and cannot deduce is not true".  See any good book on logic
programming (such as <var>Foundations of Logic Programming</var> by John Lloyd,
Springer-Verlag 1984) for a fuller explanation of this.

   <p>We would very often like an operation that corresponds to logical
negation.  That is, we would like to ask
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>not married(X).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>and have Prolog tell us the names of some people who are not married,
or to ask
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>not dead(X).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>and have Prolog name some people who are not dead.  The unprovability
operator will not do this for us.  However, we <em>can</em> use <code>\+/1</code> as
if it were negation, but only
for certain tasks under some conditions that are not very restrictive.

   <p>The first condition is that if you want to simulate <code>not(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code> with <code>\+(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code>,
you must first ensure that you have complete information about <var>p</var>.  That
is, your program must be such that every true ground instance of <var>p</var>
can be proved in finite time, and that every false ground instance of
<var>p</var> will fail in finite time.  Database programs often have this property.

   <p>Even then, given a non-ground instance of <var>p</var>, <code>not(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code> would be
expected to bind some of the variables of <var>p</var>.  But by design, <code>\+(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code> <em>never</em>
binds any variables of <var>p</var>. 
Therefore the second condition is that when you call <code>\+(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code>, <var>p</var> should be
ground, or <code>\+(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code> will not simulate <code>not(</code><var>p</var><code>)</code> properly.

   <p>Checking the first condition requires an analysis of the entire program. 
Checking that <var>p</var> is ground is relatively simple.  Therefore, the library file
<code>library(not)</code> defines an operation

<pre class="example">     not <var>Goal</var>
     </pre>

   <p>which checks whether its <var>Goal</var> argument is ground, and if it is,
attempts to prove <code>\+ </code><var>Goal</var><code></code>.  Actually, the check done is somewhat subtler
than that.  The simulation can be sound even when some variables
remain; for example, if <code>left_in_stock(Part, Count)</code> has at most one
solution for any value of <code>Part</code>, then
<pre class="example">     \+ (left_in_stock(Part,Count), Count &lt; 10)
     </pre>

   <p>is perfectly sound provided you do not use <code>Count</code> elsewhere in the
clause.  You can tell <code>not/1</code> that you take responsibility for a
variable's being safe by existentially quantifying it (see the
description of <code>setof/3</code>), so

<pre class="example">     not Count^(left_in_stock(Part,Count), Count &lt; 10)
     </pre>

   <p>demands only that <code>Part</code> must be ground. 
Even so, this is not particularly good style, and you would be
better off adding a predicate
<pre class="example">     fewer_in_stock_than(Part, Limit) :-
             left_in_stock(Part, Count),
             Count &lt; Limit.
     </pre>

   <p>and asking the question
<pre class="example">     not fewer_in_stock_than(Part, 10)
     </pre>

   <p>If you want to find instances that do not satisfy a certain test,
you can generally enumerate likely candidates and check each one. 
For example,
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>human(H), not married(H).</kbd>
     
     H = john <kbd>;</kbd>
     
     H = sue
     
     | ?- <kbd>man(M), not dead(M).</kbd>
     
     M = john <kbd>;</kbd>
     
     M = adam
     </pre>

   <p>The present library definition of <code>not/1</code> warns
you when you would get the wrong answer, and offers
you the choice of aborting the computation or accepting possible
incorrect results.
