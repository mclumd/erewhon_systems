<h5 class="subsubsection">Leashing</h5>

   <p>The purpose of leashing is to allow you to speed up single-stepping
(creeping) through a program by telling the debugger that it does not
always need to wait for user interaction at every port.

   <p>The leashing mode only applies to procedures that do not have spypoints
on them, and it determines which ports of such procedures are leashed.  By
default, all ports are leashed.  On arrival at a leashed port, the
debugger will stop to allow you to look at the execution state and decide
what to do next.  At unleashed ports, the goal is displayed but program
execution does not stop to allow user interaction.

   <p>At any time, there is a <dfn>leashing</dfn> mode in force, which determines at
which of the seven ports of a procedure box (Call, Exit, Redo, Fail,
Done, Head, and Exception) the debugger will stop and wait for a
command.  By default, the debugger will stop at every port, but
sometimes you may wish to reduce the number of times you have to issue
commands.  For example, it is often convenient only to have to interact
at the Call, Redo, and Exception ports.

   <p>To set the leashing mode, that is, to specify ports for leashing, call
<code>leash/1</code>.  The leashing mode can also be set from the options menu
of the source linked debugger (see <a href="dbg-sld.html#dbg-sld">dbg-sld</a>).

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Please note:</strong>  Spypoints are not affected by leashing; the debugger will always
stop at every port for a procedure or call on which there is a spypoint.
