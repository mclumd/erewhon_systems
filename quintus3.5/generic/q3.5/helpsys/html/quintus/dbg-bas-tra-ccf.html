<h5 class="subsubsection">Commands That Change The Flow Of Control</h5>

   <p>The debugger also has these commands that alter the flow of control of
your program.

     <dl>

     <br><dt>retry
     <dd>This can be used at any of the seven ports (although
at the Call port it has no effect).  Control is transferred back to the
Call port of the box.  It allows you to restart an invocation when,
for example, you find yourself leaving with some incorrect result.  The
state of execution is exactly the same as when you originally called the
procedure, except that clauses that have been changed by the database
modification predicates will not be changed back to their original
state.

     <br><dt>fail
     <dd>This is similar to Retry except that it transfers control to the
Fail port of the current box.  It places your execution in a situation
in which it is about to backtrack out of the current invocation,
having failed the goal.
