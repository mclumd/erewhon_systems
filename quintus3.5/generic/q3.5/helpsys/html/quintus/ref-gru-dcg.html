<h4 class="subsection">Definite Clause Grammars</h4>

   <p>Prolog's grammar rules provide a convenient notation for
expressing definite clause grammars, which are useful for the
analysis of both artificial and natural languages.

   <p>The usual way one attempts to make precise the definition of a
language, whether it is a natural language or a programming lanaguage,
is through a collection of rules called a "grammar".  The rules of a
grammar define which strings of words or symbols are valid sentences
of the language.  In addition, the grammar generally analyzes the
sentence into a structure that makes its meaning more explicit.

   <p>A fundamental class of grammar is the context-free grammar (CFG),
familiar to the computing community in the notation of "BNF"
(Backus-Naur form). In CFGs, the words, or basic symbols, of the
language are identified by "terminal symbols", while categories of
phrases of the language are identified by non-terminal symbols.  Each
rule of a CFG expresses a possible form for a non-terminal, as a
sequence of terminals and non-terminals.  The analysis of a string
according to a CFG is a parse tree, showing the constitutent phrases
of the string and their hierarchical relationships.

   <p>Context-free grammars (CFGs) consist of a series of rules of the form:
<pre class="example">     <var>nt</var> --&gt; <var>body</var>.
     </pre>

   <p>where <var>nt</var> is a non-terminal symbol and body is a sequence of one or
more items separated by commas.  Each item is either a non-terminal
symbol or a sequence of terminal symbols.  The meaning of the rule is
that <var>body</var> is a possible form for a phrase of type <var>nt</var>. A
non-terminal symbol is written as a Prolog atom, while a sequence of
terminals is written as a Prolog list, whereas a terminal may be any
Prolog term.

   <p>Definite clause grammars (DCGs) are a generalization of context-free grammars
and rules corresponding to DCGs are referred to as "Grammar Rules". 
A grammar rule in Prolog takes the general form
<pre class="example">     <var>head</var> --&gt; <var>body</var>.
     </pre>

   <p>meaning "a possible form for  <var>head</var>  is  <var>body</var>". 
Both  <var>body</var>  and  <var>head</var>  are
sequences  of  one  or  more  items  linked  by  the  standard  Prolog
conjunction operator <code>,</code> (comma).

   <p>Definite clause grammars  extend  context-free  grammars  in  the
following ways:

     <ul>

     <li>A non-terminal symbol  may  be  any  Prolog  term  (other  than  a
variable or integer). 
<li>A  terminal  symbol  may  be  any  Prolog  term.   To  distinguish
terminals  from  non-terminals,  a  sequence  of  one or more terminal
symbols is written within a grammar rule as a Prolog list.   An  empty
sequence  is  written  as the empty list <code>[]</code>. If the terminal symbols
are ASCII character codes, such lists can be written (as elsewhere) as
strings.  An empty sequence is written as the empty list (<code>[]</code> or
<code>""</code>).

     <li>Extra conditions, in the form of Prolog procedure  calls,  may  be
included  in  the  right-hand  side of a grammar rule. 
These extra conditions allow the explicit use of procedure calls in the
body of a rule to restrict the constitutents accepted.  Such procedure
calls are written enclosed in curly brackets (<code>{</code> and <code>}</code>). 
<li>The left-hand side of a grammar rule consists of  a  non-terminal,
optionally  followed  by  a  sequence of terminals (again written as a
Prolog list). 
<li>Alternatives may be stated explicitly in the right-hand side of  a
grammar rule, using the disjunction operator <code>;</code> (semicolon)
as in Prolog.  (The disjunction operator can also be written as <code>|</code>
(vertical-bar).) 
<li>The cut symbol <code>!</code> (exclamation point) may be included in the
right-hand side of a grammar
rule,  as  in  a  Prolog  clause.   The cut symbol does not need to be
enclosed in curly brackets.  The conditional arrow <code>-&gt;</code> can also be used
in grammar rules, without the curly brackets.  However, all other control
predicates, <code>repeat/0</code> for example, can only be used within curly
brackets.  If you use the goal <code>repeat/0</code> without the brackets it will be
taken to be a non-terminal symbol.

     <li>The extra arguments of non-terminals provide the means of building structure
(such as parse trees) in grammar rules.  As non-terminals are "expanded" by
matching against grammar rules, structures are progressively built up in the course of the unification
process. 
<li>The extra arguments of non-terminals can also provide a general treatment
of context dependency by carrying test and contextual information.
