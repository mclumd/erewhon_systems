<h5 class="subsubsection">Overview</h5>

   <p>The Emacs/Prolog interface is designed to enable you to create a
Prolog program in a file outside the Prolog environment and then to
move back and forth easily between that file and the Prolog
environment.  Both the Prolog program and your interaction with Prolog
are preserved in edit buffers, which can easily be reviewed and
modified. The Emacs process is primary, and Prolog runs as a buffer within it.

   <p>In the Prolog window, Prolog programs can be run, and Emacs commands
can be used to edit and resubmit previously-entered Prolog commands. 
In a text window, single procedures, groups of procedures, and
entire programs can be edited and quickly reloaded into Prolog without
suspending the Prolog process.  Additionally, any number of Prolog
source files can be loaded into Prolog at once; then, if desired,
Emacs can be used to locate a specific procedure in any one of those
files.  (For more information, see <a href="ema-ove-loc.html#ema-ove-loc">ema-ove-loc</a>.)
