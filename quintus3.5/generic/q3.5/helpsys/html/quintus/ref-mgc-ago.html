   <p>By default, atoms created during the execution of a program remain permanently
in the system until Prolog exits. For the majority of applications
this behavior is not a problem and can be ignored. 
However, for two classes of application this can present problems. Firstly
the internal architecture of Quintus Prolog limits the number of atoms that be can
created to 2,031,616 and this can be a problem for database applications that
read large numbers of atoms from a database. Secondly, the space occupied
by atoms can become significant and dominant memory usage, which can be
a problem for processes designed to run perpetually.

   <p>These problems can be overcome by using atom garbage collection
to reclaim atoms that are no longer accessible to the executing program.

   <p>Atoms can be created in many ways: when an appropriate
token is read with <code>read_term/3</code>, when source or QOF files are loaded, when
<code>atom_chars/2</code> is called with a character list, or
when <code>QP_atom_from_string()</code> is called in C code. 
In any of these contexts an atom is only
created if it does not already exist;
all atoms for a given string are given the same identification
number, which is different from the atom of any other string.  Thus,
atom recognition and comparison can be done quickly, without having to
look at strings.  An occurrence of an atom is
always of a fixed, small size, so where a given atom is likely to be used
in several places simultaneously the use of atoms can also be more
compact than the use of strings.

   <p>A Prolog functor is implemented like an atom, but also has an associated
arity.  For the purposes of atom garbage collection, a functor is considered
to be an occurrence of the atom of that same name.

   <p>Atom garbage collection is similar to heap garbage collection except that
it is not invoked automatically, but rather through a call to the built-in
predicate <code>garbage_collect_atoms/0</code>. 
The atom garbage collector scans Prolog's data areas looking
for atoms that are currently in use and  then throws away all unused atoms,
reclaiming their space.

   <p>Atom garbage collection can turn an application
that continually grows and eventually either runs into the atom number limit
or runs out of space into one that can run perpetually.  It can also
make feasible applications that load and manipulate huge
quantities of atom-rich data that would otherwise become full of
useless atoms.
