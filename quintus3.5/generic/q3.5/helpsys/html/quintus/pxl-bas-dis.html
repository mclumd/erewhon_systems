<h4 class="subsection">Displays and Screens</h4>

   <p>A ProXL <dfn>screen</dfn> is what it sounds like: a physical screen on a
monitor.  Normally each CPU has one screen associated with it. 
However, there can be more; for instance, you might have both a color
and a monochrome screen.  ProXL allows programs to use all
available screens.

   <p>X is <dfn>network transparent</dfn>, meaning that a program may open windows on
any screen that is accessible through a network.  This is possible
because commands to X are sent via interprocess communication (IPC) to
a separate <dfn>X server</dfn> process, which actually does the work.  A
ProXL <dfn>display</dfn> is essentially a connection between your Prolog
program and the X server.  Think of a <dfn>display</dfn> as one CPU on a
network.  Each display has a fixed number of <dfn>screens</dfn>, one of
which is opened by default upon opening X.  Also, given a display, you
can enumerate its screens, as well as find its default
screen.

   <p>Unless network transparency is being exploited, a ProXL programmer
will not normally have to deal with displays explicitly.  Screens are
almost always handled by a default mechanism.  Consult an Xlib manual
for an overview of how screens and displays are used and why they
exist.
