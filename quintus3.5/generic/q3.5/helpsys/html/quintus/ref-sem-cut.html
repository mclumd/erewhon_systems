<h4 class="subsection">The Cut</h4>

   <p>Besides the sequencing of goals and clauses, Prolog provides one
other  very  important  facility  for  specifying control information. 
This is the <dfn>cut</dfn>, written <code>!</code>. 
It is  inserted  in  the  program
just  like  a  goal, but is not to be regarded as part of the logic of
the program and should be ignored as far as the declarative  semantics
is concerned.

   <p>The  effect  of  the  cut  is  as  follows.   When  first
encountered  as  a  goal,  cut  succeeds immediately.  If backtracking
should later return to the cut, the effect  is  to  fail  the  <em>parent
goal</em>, that goal that matched the head of the clause containing
the cut, and caused the clause to be activated.  In other  words,  the
cut  operation <em>commits</em> the system to all choices made since the parent
goal was invoked, and causes other alternatives to be discarded.   The
goals  thus  rendered  <em>determinate</em>  are  the parent goal itself, any
goals occurring before the cut in the clause containing the  cut,  and
any  subgoals  that  were  executed  during  the  execution  of those
preceding goals.

   <p>For example, the procedure
<pre class="example">     member(X, [X|L]).
     member(X, [Y|L]) :-
        member(X, L).
     </pre>

   <p>can be used to test whether a given term is in a list:
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>member(b, [a,b,c]).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>returns the answer <code>yes</code>. 
The procedure can also be used to extract elements from a list, as in
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>member(X, [d,e,f]).</kbd>
     </pre>

   <p>With backtracking this will successively return each element of the list. 
Now suppose that the first clause had been written instead:
<pre class="example">     member(X, [X|L]) :- !.
     </pre>

   <p>In this case, the second call above would extract only the first element
of the list (<code>d</code>). 
On backtracking, the cut would immediately fail the entire procedure.

   <p>Another example:
<pre class="example">     x :- p, !, q.
     x :- r.
     </pre>

   <p>This is analogous to "if p then q else r" in an Algol-like language.

   <p>Note that a cut discards all the alternatives subsequent to
the parent goal, even when the cut appears within  a  disjunction.  This
means  that  the normal method for eliminating a disjunction -- by
defining
an extra predicate -- cannot be applied to a disjunction containing a
cut.
