<h3 class="section">Abstracts</h3>

   <p>The following abstracts are meant to describe the functionality of
each package, not to serve as documentation.  Whatever documentation
exists is included in comments within each package.  Refer to
<a href="lib-bas-dlp-acc.html#lib-bas-dlp-acc">lib-bas-dlp-acc</a> to find out how to locate the source files if
you wish to read the code comments.  All the files abstracted in the
following pages are found in the library directory.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>library(aggregate)</code>
     <dd>defines <code>aggregate/3</code>, an operation
similar to <code>bagof/3</code>, which lets you calculate sums.  For example,
given a table <code>pupil(Name, Class, Age)</code>, to calculate the average
age of the pupils in each class, one would write
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>aggregate( sum(Age)/sum(1),
                          Name^pupil(Class, Name, Age),
                          Expr),
               call(Average_Age is Expr).</kbd>
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>library(antiunify)</code>
     <dd>
Anti-unification is the mathematical dual of unification:  given two
    terms <var>T1</var> and <var>T2</var> it returns the most specific term that generalizes
    them, <var>T</var>.  <var>T</var> is the most specific term that unifies with both <var>T1</var> and
    <var>T2</var>.  A common use for this is in learning; the idea of using it that
    way comes from Gordon Plotkin.

     <p>The code here is based on a routine called <code>generalise/5</code> written by
    Fernando Pereira.  The name was changed because there are other ways
    of generalizing things, but there is only one dual of unification.

          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>anti_unify(</code><var>+Term1</var><code>, </code><var>+Term2</var><code>, </code><var>-Term</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>binds <var>Term</var> to a most specific
generalization of <var>Term1</var> and <var>Term2</var>.  When you call it, <var>Term</var> should be a
variable.

          <br><dt><code>anti_unify(</code><var>+Term1</var><code>, </code><var>+Term2</var><code>, </code><var>-Subst1</var><code>, </code><var>-Subst2</var><code>, </code><var>-Term</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>binds
<var>Term</var> to a most specific generalization of <var>Term1</var> and <var>Term2</var>, and <var>Subst1</var>
and <var>Subst2</var> to substitutions such that
          <pre class="example">                      Subst1(Term) = Term1
                      Subst2(Term) = Term2
               </pre>

          <p>Substitutions are represented as lists of <var>Var=Term</var> pairs, where
   <var>Var</var> is a Prolog variable, and <var>Term</var> is the term to substitute for <var>Var</var>. 
   When you call <code>anti_unify/5</code>, <var>Subst1</var>, <var>Subst2</var>, and <var>Term</var> should be variables.

     </dl>

     <br><dt><code>library(arity)</code>
     <dd>Provides support for Arity code translated by <code>arity2quintus</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(aritystring)</code>
     <dd>provides support for Arity's string operations.

     <br><dt><code>library(aropen)</code>
     <dd>lets you open a member of a UNIX
archive file (see UNIX <code>ar(1)</code>) without having to
extract the member.  You cannot compile or consult such a file,
but you can read from it.  This may be useful as an example of
defining Prolog streams from C. 
Not available under Windows.

     <br><dt><code>library(arrays)</code>
     <dd>provides constant-time access and
update to arrays.  It involves a fairly unpleasant hack.  You
would be better off using <code>library(logarr)</code> or <code>library(trees)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(assoc)</code>
     <dd>A binary tree implementation of "association lists".

     <br><dt><code>library(avl)</code>
     <dd>AVL trees in Prolog.

     <br><dt><code>library(bags)</code>
     <dd>provides support for the data type <dfn>bag</dfn>.

     <br><dt><code>library(benchmark)</code>
     <dd>Users can easily obtain information about the
performance of goals:  time and memory requirements.

     <br><dt><code>library(between)</code>
     <dd>provides routines for generating integers on
backtracking.

     <br><dt><code>library(big_text)</code>
     <dd>Defines a <dfn>big_text</dfn> data type and several operations
on it.  The point of this module is that when writing an interactive
program you often want to display to (or acquire from) the user large
amounts of text.  It would be inadvisable (though possible) to store
the text in Prolog's database.  With this package you can store text
in a file, copy text to a stream, acquire new text from a stream,
and/or have Emacs edit a big text file.  See the file <code>big_text.txt</code> in
the library area for more details.

     <br><dt><code>library(bitsets)</code>
     <dd>Operations on sets of integers (<dfn>bitsets</dfn>).  Contains
analogs for most operations in <code>library(ordsets)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(break)</code>
     <dd>Prints an error message and enters a break level (if
possible), avoiding the problem of <code>break/0</code> in QPC.

     <br><dt><code>library(call)</code>
     <dd>provides a number of predicates that are useful in
programs that pass goals as arguments.

     <br><dt><code>library(caseconv)</code>
     <dd>is mainly intended as an example of the use
        of <code>library(ctypes)</code>.  Here you'll find
        predicates to test whether text is in all lowercase, all
        uppercase, or mixed-case, and to convert from one case to
        another.

     <br><dt><code>library(charsio)</code>
     <dd>lets you open a list of character
codes for input as a Prolog stream and, having written to a Prolog
stream, collect the output as a list of character codes.  There are
three things you can do with <code>library(charsio)</code>:
          <ol type=1 start=1>

          <li>You can open an input stream reading from a (ground) list of characters. 
This is the predicate <code>chars_to_stream</code>. 
<li>You can run a particular goal with input coming from a (ground) list
of characters.  The predicates <code>with_input_from_chars/[2,3]</code> do this. 
<li>You can run a particular goal with output going to a list of characters
(the unification is done after the goal has finished). 
The <code>with_output_to_chars/[2,3]</code> predicates do this.
          </ol>

     <br><dt><code>library(clump)</code>
     <dd>Group adjacent related elements of lists.

     <br><dt><code>library(count)</code>
     <dd>The purpose is to count predicate calls.  Instead of loading
a program by calling <code>compile/1</code>, use <code>count/1</code>.  The program will do
what it always used to, except that it may run twice as slowly.  The
output of <code>library(count)</code> is a file that contains a record of predicate
calls, and is suitable for processing by <code>awk(1)</code> or similar
utilities.

     <br><dt><code>library(critical)</code>
     <dd>provides a critical-region facility.

     <br><dt><code>library(crypt)</code>
     <dd>
 defines two operations similar to <code>open/3</code>:

     <p><code>crypt_open(</code><var>+FileName</var><code>[, </code><var>+Password</var><code></code>, <var>+Mode</var>, <var>-Stream</var>)]

     <p>If you do not supply a <var>Password</var>, <code>crypt_open/3</code> will prompt
        you for it.  Note that the password <em>will</em> be echoed.  If
        there is demand, this can be changed.  The <var>Stream</var> will
        be clear text as far as Prolog is concerned, yet
        encrypted as far as the file system is concerned.

     <p><code>encrypt.c</code> is a stand-alone program (which is designed to
        have its object code linked to <em>three</em> names:  <code>encrypt</code>,
        <code>decrypt</code>, and <code>recrypt</code>), and can be used to read and write
        files using this encryption method.

     <p>This encryption method was designed, and the code was
        published, in Edinburgh, so it is available outside the USA.

     <br><dt><code>library(decons)</code>
     <dd>provides a set of routines for recognizing
        and building Prolog control structures.  The
        only predicate that is likely to be useful
        is <code>prolog_clause(</code><var>Clause</var><code>, </code><var>Head</var><code>, </code><var>Body</var><code>)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(demo)</code>
     <dd>Defines the <code>demo</code> <code>file_search_path</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(det)</code>
     <dd>Aids in determinacy checking by locating places where cuts are
really necessary.

     <br><dt><code>library(environ)</code>
     <dd>provides access to the operating system's
<dfn>environment variables</dfn>. 
<code>environ(</code><var>?Varname</var><code>, </code><var>?Value</var><code>)</code> is a genuine relation.  Note
that if you include this file in a saved state, the values of
environment variables are those current when the saved state was run,
not when it was saved.  There is also an <code>argv/1</code> in this file, which is superseded by <code>unix(argv(_))</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(environment)</code>
     <dd>Portability aid for UNIX (BSD, System V), Windows,
VMS, VM/SP (CMS), MVS, MS-DOS, Macintosh.

     <br><dt><code>library(expansion)</code>
     <dd>This library "takes over" <code>term_expansion/2</code> and provides more powerful hooks
that enable multiple, "simultaneously active" and recursive program
transformations to be achieved in an effcient manner.

     <br><dt><code>library(fft)</code>
     <dd>Performs a fast fourier transform in Prolog. This file was
written to demonstrate that a FFT could be written in Prolog with the
same <var>O(N*</var>log<var>(N))</var> <em>asymptotic</em> cost as in Fortran.  There are several
easy things that could be done to make it faster, but you would be
better off for numerical calculations like this using <code>library(vectors)</code>
to call a Fortran subroutine.

     <br><dt><code>library(filename)</code>
     <dd>Portable filename manipulation. 
Documentation on <code>filename.txt</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(flatten)</code>
     <dd>provides predicates for flattening binary
trees into lists.

     <br><dt><code>library(foreach)</code>
     <dd>
 defines two iteration forms.

     <pre class="example">          forall(<var>Generator, Test</var>)
          foreach(<var>Generator</var>, <var>Test</var>)
          </pre>

     <p><code>forall/2</code> is the standard double-negation "there is no proof of
            <var>Generator</var> for which <var>Test</var> is not provable", coded as
            <code>\+ (</code><var>Generator</var><code>, \+ </code><var>Test</var><code>)</code>.

     <p><code>foreach/2</code> works in three phases:  first each provable instance of
            <var>Generator</var> is found, then each corresponding instance
            of <var>Test</var> is collected in a conjunction, and finally
            the conjunction is executed.

     <p>If, by the time a <var>Test</var> is called, it is always ground
        -- apart from explicitly existentially quantified variables --
        the two forms of iteration are equivalent, and <code>forall/2</code> is
        cheaper.  But if you want <var>Test</var> to bind some variables,
        you must use <code>foreach/2</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(freevars)</code>
     <dd>This is an internal support package. 
Users will probably have no direct use for it.

     <br><dt><code>library(fromonto)</code>
     <dd>
 defines some "pretty" operators
for input/output redirection.  Examples:
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>(repeat, read(X), process(X))
               from_file 'fred.dat'.</kbd>
          
          | ?- <kbd>read(X) from_chars "example. ".</kbd>
          
          X = example
          
          | ?- <kbd>write(273.4000) onto_chars X.</kbd>
          
          X = "273.4"
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>library(gauss)</code>
     <dd>Gaussian elimination.

     <br><dt><code>library(getfile)</code>
     <dd>defines <code>get_file(</code><var>+FileName</var><code>, </code><var>-ListOfLines</var><code>)</code>, which reads an
entire file into memory in one go.

     <br><dt><code>library(graphs)</code>
     <dd>
a collection of utilities for manipulating
mathematical graphs.  The collection is incomplete.  Please
let us know which operations in this collection are most useful to you,
and which operations that you would find useful have not been included.

     <p>The P-representation of a graph is a list of (from-to) vertex
pairs, where the pairs can be in an arbitrary order.  This form is
convenient for input and output.

     <p>The S-representation of a graph is a list of (vertex-neighbors)
pairs, where the pairs are in standard order (as produced by
<code>keysort/2</code>) and the neighbors of each vertex are also in standard
order (as produced by <code>sort/2</code>).  This form is convenient for many
calculations.

     <p>See also <code>library(mst)</code> (<a href="lib-abs.html#lib-abs">lib-abs</a>),
which is soon to be merged into <code>library(graphs)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(heaps)</code>
     <dd>provides support for the data type <dfn>heap</dfn> (heaps are
also known as priority queues).

     <br><dt><code>library(knuth_b_1)</code>
     <dd>is a table of constants taken
from Appendix B1 of D.E. Knuth's <cite>The Art of Computer Programming</cite>,
Volume 1.  The point is not to provide the constants -- you
could have calculated them yourselves easily enough -- but
to illustrate the recommended way of building such constants into
your programs.

     <br><dt><code>library(listparts)</code>
     <dd>exists to establish a common
vocabulary for names of parts of lists among Prolog programmers.

     <br><dt><code>library(lpa)</code>
     <dd>Compatibility library for LPA Prologs.  See also <code>quintus.mac</code>, <code>quintus.dec</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(logarr)</code>
     <dd>is an implementation of "arrays"
as 4-way trees.  See also <code>library(trees)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(long)</code>
     <dd>
 This is a rational arithmetic package.

     <p><code>rational(</code><var>N</var><code>)</code> recognizes arbitrary-precision rational numbers:
        this includes integers, <code>infinity</code>, <code>neginfinity</code>, &amp; <code>undefined</code>. 
        <code>whole(</code><var>N</var><code>)</code> recognizes arbitrary precision integers. 
        <code>eval(</code><var>Expr</var><code>, </code><var>Result</var><code>)</code> evaluates an expression using arbitrary
        precision rational arithmetic; it does <em>not</em> accept floats at all. 
        <code>{eq,ge,gt,le,lt,ne}/2</code> are infix predicates like <code>&lt;/2</code> that compare
        rationals (or integers, <em>not</em> expressions). 
        <code>succ/2</code>, <code>plus/3</code>, and <code>times/3</code> are relational forms of arithmetic,
        which work on rational numbers (<em>not</em> floats). 
        To have rational numbers printed nicely, put the command
     <pre class="example">          :- assert((portray(X) :- portray_number(X)))
          </pre>

     <p>in your code.  See <code>long.doc</code> and the comments in <code>long.pl</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(mapand)</code>
     <dd>provides mapping routines over &amp;-trees.  See also <code>maplist.pl</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(maplist)</code>
     <dd>is built on top of <code>library(call)</code>, and provides
a collection of meta-predicates for applying predicates to elements of lists.

     <br><dt><code>library(maps)</code>
     <dd>implements functions over finite domains, which
functions are represented by an explicit data structure.

     <br><dt><code>library(menu)</code>
     <dd>

     <p>illustrates how to drive the Emacs interface from
Prolog.  The sample application involves choosing items from a menu. 
See also the <code>menu_example.pl</code> program in the demo directory. 
Not available under Windows.

     <br><dt><code>library(mst)</code>
     <dd>
 is a preliminary version of a minimal spanning tree
package, that will eventually be merged into <code>library(graphs)</code>.

     <p><code>library(mst)</code> currently provides two predicates:
          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>first_mst(</code><var>+Nodes</var><code>, </code><var>+Cost</var><code>, </code><var>-Root</var><code>, </code><var>-MST</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>

          <br><dt><code>mst(</code><var>+Nodes</var><code>, </code><var>+Cost</var><code>, </code><var>-Root</var><code>, </code><var>-MST</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
               <ul>

               <li><var>Nodes</var> is a list of nodes. 
<li><var>Cost</var> is a predicate that takes three extra arguments.  A predicate from
<code>library(call)</code>, <code>call(</code><var>Cost</var><code>, </code><var>X</var><code>, </code><var>Y</var><code>, </code><var>Dist</var><code>)</code> calculates
the distance <var>Dist</var> between nodes <var>X</var> and <var>Y</var>. 
<li><var>Root</var> is the root of a minimal spanning tree and <var>MST</var> is a list
of the arcs in that minimal spanning tree. 
</ul>

     </dl>

     <blockquote>

          <p><strong>Please note:</strong>  <code>mst/4</code> has been carefully written so that it
will find all the minimal spanning trees of a graph. 
<code>mst/4</code> finds many trees, especially as it is blind to redundant
representations of isomorphic trees.  If you will be satisfied
with any MST at all, use <code>first_mst/4</code> instead. 
<code>first_mst/4</code> will try to keep the arcs in the same order as the
nodes if at all possible. 
</blockquote>

     <br><dt><code>library(multil)</code>
     <dd>provides multiple-list routines.

     <br><dt><code>library(newqueues)</code>
     <dd>provides support for the <dfn>queue</dfn> data type. 
The <code>library(newqueues)</code> package replaces <code>library(queues)</code>, and should be
used in new programs.

     <br><dt><code>library(nlist)</code>
     <dd>Interface to the UNIX library function <code>nlist(3)</code>. 
Not available under Windows.

     <br><dt><code>library(note)</code>
     <dd>The built-in predicates and commands pertaining to the
"recorded" (or "internal") database have an argument called the
"key".  All that matters about this key is its principal functor. 
That is, <code>fred(a, b)</code> and <code>fred(97, 46)</code> are regarded as the same key.

     <p><code>library(note)</code> defines a complete set of storing, fetching, and
deleting commands where the "key" is a ground term <em>all</em> of
which is significant, using the existing recorded database. 
Note that this package is no better indexed than the existing
recorded database.

     <br><dt><code>library(order)</code>
     <dd> The
usual convention for Prolog operations is INPUTS before OUTPUTS.  The
built-in predicate <code>compare/3</code> violates this.  This package provides an
additional interface to provide comparison predicates with the usual order. 
The package contains predicates to compare numbers, terms, sets and ordered
lists.

     <br><dt><code>library(ordered)</code>
     <dd>is a collection of predicates for doing things
with a list and an ordering predicate.  See also
<code>library(ordsets)</code> (<a href="lib-lis-ordsets.html#lib-lis-ordsets">lib-lis-ordsets</a>), <code>library(ordprefix)</code> below, and <code>library(samsort)</code> (<a href="lib-abs.html#lib-abs">lib-abs</a>).

     <br><dt><code>library(ordprefix)</code>
     <dd>is for extracting initial
runs from lists, perhaps with a user-supplied ordering predicate. 
See also <code>library(ordered)</code> above.

     <br><dt><code>quintus.mac</code>
     <dd>version of <code>lpa.pl</code> to be used on Mac.

     <br><dt><code>quintus.dec</code>
     <dd>version of <code>lpa.pl</code> to be used on DEC.

     <br><dt><code>library(pipe)</code>
     <dd>
 Quintus streams may be connected to pipes using <code>library(pipe)</code>, which
provides a single predicate:

          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>popen(</code><var>+Command</var><code>, </code><var>+Mode</var><code>, </code><var>-Stream</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
<var>Mode</var> may be either:
               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>read</code>
               <dd><var>Stream</var> will be bound to a new input stream, connected to
the standard output of the <var>Command</var>.  The standard input stream of
the <var>Command</var> is left the same as the standard input stream of
Prolog.  So we have
               <pre class="example">                    user_input -&gt; <var>Command</var> -&gt; <var>Stream</var>
                    </pre>

               <br><dt><code>write</code>
               <dd><var>Stream</var> will be bound to a new output stream, connected
to the standard input of the <var>Command</var>.  The standard output stream
of the <var>Command</var> is left the same as the standard output stream of
Prolog.  So we have
               <pre class="example">                    <var>Stream</var> -&gt; <var>Command</var> -&gt; user_output
                    </pre>

          </dl>

     </dl>

     <p>The behavior of <code>popen/3</code> is defined by the system function <code>popen(3S)</code>. 
There is no special
<code>pclose/1</code> command: the existing <code>close/1</code> will call
<code>pclose(3S)</code>.  Commands are executed by <code>sh(1)</code> under UNIX
and by the default command interpreter under Windows,
e.g. <code>cmd.exe</code> under Windows XP.  Under Windows, the underlying
<code>popen()</code> C library function, and therefore also <code>popen/3</code>,
only works in console applications, e.g. in <code>prolog</code> but not
in <code>qpwin</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(plot)</code>
     <dd>This package generates UNIX <code>plot(5)</code> files.

     <br><dt><code>library(pptree)</code>
     <dd>
 This file defines pretty-printers for (parse) trees represented in the form
     <pre class="example">          &lt;tree&gt; --&gt; &lt;node label&gt;/[&lt;son&gt;,...&lt;son&gt;]
                  |  &lt;leaf label&gt;         -- anything else
          </pre>

     <p>Two forms of output are provided:  a human-readable form and
        a Prolog term form for reading back into Prolog.
          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>pp_tree(</code><var>+Tree</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>prints the version intended for human consumption, and

          <br><dt><code>pp_term(</code><var>+Tree</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>prints the Prolog-readable version. 
</dl>

     <p>There is a new command <code>ps_tree/1</code>, which prints trees
represented in the form
     <pre class="example">          &lt;tree&gt; --&gt; &lt;node label&gt;(&lt;son&gt;,...,&lt;son&gt;)
                  |  &lt;leaf&gt;               -- constants
          </pre>

     <p>The output of <code>ps_tree/1</code> is readable by Prolog and people both. 
You may find it useful for things other than parse trees.

     <br><dt><code>library(printchars)</code>
     <dd>extends <code>portray/1</code> (using <code>library(addportray)</code>) so
that lists of character codes are written by <code>print/1</code>, by the top
level, and by the debugger, between double quotes.
     <pre class="example">          
          | ?- <kbd>X = "fred".</kbd>
          
          X = [102,114,101,100]
          
          | ?- <kbd>use_module(library(printchars)),
               X = "fred".</kbd>
          
          X = "fred"
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>library(printlength)</code>
     <dd>provides predicates for determining
how wide a term would be if written.

     <br><dt><code>library(putfile)</code>
     <dd>Uses C stream functions to copy the contents of a file to
the the current output stream.  This is the fastest known method for
copying the contents of a file to the current output
stream.

     <br><dt><code>library(qerrno)</code>
     <dd>Defines error codes specific to Quintus Prolog, which do not
have any standard errno assignment.

     <br><dt><code>library(qsort)</code>
     <dd>provides a stable version of quicksort. 
        Note that quicksort is <em>not</em> a good sorting method for
        a language like Prolog.  If you want a good sorting method,
        see <code>library(samsort)</code> below.

     <br><dt><code>library(queues)</code>
     <dd>provides support for the <dfn>queue</dfn> data type. 
This library has been made obsolete in release 3 by the introduction
of <code>library(newqueues)</code>.  It is retained for backward compatibility, but
should not be used in new programs.

     <br><dt><code>library(random)</code>
     <dd>provides a random number generator
and several handy interface routines.  The random number
generators supplied by various operating systems are
all different.  It is useful to have a random number generator that
will give the same results in all versions of Quintus Prolog, and this
is the one.

     <br><dt><code>library(ranstk)</code>
     <dd>This is a Prolog implementation of the algorithms in Eugene
W. Myers' <var>An Applicative Random-Access Stack</var>.

     <br><dt><code>library(read)</code>
     <dd>
 This code was originally written at the University of Edinburgh. 
David H. D. Warren wrote the first version of the parser.  Richard A. 
O'Keefe extracted it from the Dec-10 Prolog system and made it use
only user-visible operations.  He also added the feature whereby
<code>P(X,Y,Z)</code> is read as <code>call(P,X,Y,Z)</code>.  Alan Mycroft reorganized the code
to regularize the functor modes.  This is easier to understand (there
are no more <code>?</code>s), and it also fixes bugs concerning the curious
interaction of cut with the state of parameter instantiation.  O'Keefe
then took it over again and made a number of other changes.

     <p>There are three intentional differences between this library and the
Dec-10 Prolog parser:

          <ul>

          <li>        "Predicate variables" serve as syntactic saccharine for <code>call/N</code>. 
<li>        When there is a syntax error, DEC-10 Prolog will backtrack
        internally and read the next term.  This fails.  If you
        call <code>portable_read/1</code> with an uninstantiated argument,
        failure means a syntax error.  You can rely on it. 
<li>        <code>, ..</code> is not accepted in place of <code>|</code>.  This was always a
        parser feature, not a tokeniser feature:  any amount of
        layout and commentary was allowed between the <code>,</code> and the
        <code>..</code>.  It wouldn't be hard to allow this again. 
</ul>

     <br><dt><code>library(retract)</code>
     <dd>This file adds more predicates for accessing dynamic clauses and
the recorded database. 
The built-in predicate <code>retract/1</code> will backtrack
through a predicate, expunging each matching clause until the caller
is satisfied.  <em>This is not a bug.</em>  That is the way <code>retract/1</code>
is <em>supposed</em> to work.  But it is also useful to have a version that
does not backtrack.

     <p><code>library(retract)</code> defines, among many other commands,
<code>retract_first/1</code>, which is identical to <code>retract/1</code> except that it
expunges only the first matching clause, and fails if asked for another
solution.

     <br><dt><code>library(samsort)</code>
     <dd>provides a stable sorting routine,
which exploits existing order, both ascending and descending. 
(It is a generalization of the natural merge.)  <code>samsort(</code><var>Raw</var><code>, </code><var>Sorted</var><code>)</code>
is like <code>sort(</code><var>Raw</var><code>, </code><var>Sorted</var><code>)</code> except that it does not discard
duplicate elements.  <code>samsort(</code><var>Order</var><code>, </code><var>Raw</var><code>, </code><var>Sorted</var><code>)</code> lets you specify
your own comparison predicate, which the built-in sorting predicates
<code>sort/2</code> and <code>keysort/2</code> do not.  This file also exports
two predicates for merging already-sorted lists:  <code>merge/3</code> and <code>merge/4</code>. 
See also <code>library(ordered)</code> and <code>library(qsort)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(setof)</code>
     <dd>provides additional predicates related to the
built-in predicate <code>setof/3</code>. 
Note that the built-in predicates <code>bagof/3</code> and <code>setof/3</code>
are much more efficient than the
predicates in this file.  See also <code>library(findall)</code>.

     <br><dt><code>library(show)</code>
     <dd>The built-in command <code>listing/1</code> displays dynamic predicates. 
But there is no built-in command for displaying the terms recorded under
a given key.  <code>library(show)</code> defines two predicates:  <code>show(</code><var>Key</var><code>)</code> displays
all the terms recorded under the given <var>Key</var>, and <code>show/0</code> displays all
the <var>Keys</var> and terms in the recorded database.

     <br><dt><code>library(showmodule)</code>
     <dd>
 provides a command for displaying
information about a loaded module.  <code>show_module(</code><var>Module</var><code>)</code> prints a
description of the <var>Module</var>, what it exports, and what it imports. 
The command
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>show_module(_), fail ; true.</kbd>
          </pre>

     <p>will print a description of every loaded module. 
To backtrack through all current modules and print
information about the predicates they define, import, and export, use
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>ensure_loaded(library(showmodule)),
               show_module(Module).</kbd>
          </pre>

     <p>To print information about a particular module <var>m</var>, use
     <pre class="example">          | ?- <kbd>show_module(</kbd><var>m</var><kbd>)</kbd>.
          </pre>

     <br><dt><code>library(statistics)</code>
     <dd>
 The <code>full_statistics/[0,2]</code> predicates are exactly like the built-in
<code>statistics/[0,2]</code> predicates except that
          <ul>

          <li>Integers are written out with commas every three digits. 
<li>The number of page faults is reported (if known). 
</ul>

     <br><dt><code>library(stchk)</code>
     <dd>
 This package allows local style-check modifications in a file. 
This module provides an alternative interface to the
    style check flags.  The idea is that a file that uses it
    will look like

     <pre class="example">              &lt;usual heading&gt;
          
              :- push_style.
              :- set_style(StyleFlag, Value).
              ...
          
              &lt;clauses&gt;
          
              :- pop_style.
          </pre>

     <p>Some combination of this with the existing style check
    interface will be safe:  no matter what style check
    changes are made, the original values will be restored.

     <p>The initial state (assumed) is that all checks are ON.

     <br><dt><code>library(terms)</code>
     <dd>
 The foreign code interface provides means of
passing constants between Prolog and C, FORTRAN, Pascal, etc.

     <p><code>library(terms)</code> lets you pass copies of terms
from Prolog to C, and receive copies of terms from C.  For example, the
new built-in predicate <code>copy_term/2</code> could have been defined this
way:
     <pre class="example">          'copy term'(Term, Copy) :-
                  prolog_to_c(Term, Pointer_to_C_version),
                  c_to_prolog(Pointer_to_C_version, Temp),
                  erase_c_term(Pointer_to_C_version),
                  Copy = Temp.
          </pre>

     <p>The C code in <code>terms.c</code> is just as much a part of this package as the
Prolog code.  In particular, the comments in that file describe the
representation used on the C side of the interface and there are
routines and macros (see <code>terms.h</code>) for accessing terms-in-C.

     <br><dt><code>library(termdepth)</code>
     <dd>Many resolution-based theorem provers impose a depth bound
on the terms they create -- not least to prevent infinite loops. 
<code>library(termdepth)</code> provides predicates that find the depth, length and size
of a term, which can even be used on cyclic terms.

     <br><dt><code>library(tokens)</code>
     <dd>
 This package is a public-domain tokeniser in reasonably standard Prolog.  It is meant to complement the library READ routine. 
    It recognizes Dec-10 Prolog with the following exceptions:
          <ul>

          <li>        <code>%(</code> is not accepted as an alternative to <code>{</code>
<li>        <code>%)</code> is not accepted as an alternative to <code>}</code>
<li>        <code>,..</code> is not accepted as an alternative to <code>|</code>
<li>        large integers are not read in as <code>xwd(</code><var>Top18Bits</var><code>,</code><var>Bottom18Bits</var><code>)</code>
<li>After a comma, <code>(</code> is read as <code> (</code> rather than <code>(</code>.  This does the
parser no harm at all, and the Dec-10 tokeniser guarantees never to
return <code>(</code> except immediately after an atom, yielding <code> (</code> everywhere
else. 
</ul>

     <p><em>BEWARE</em>: this file does not recognize floating-point numbers.

     <br><dt><code>library(trees)</code>
     <dd>is an implementation of arrays as
binary trees.

     <br><dt><code>library(types)</code>
     <dd>This file is support for the rest of the library, and is
not really meant for general use.  The type tests it defines are
almost certain to remain in the library or to migrate to the
system.  The error checking and reporting code is certain to change. 
The library predicates <code>must_be_compound/3</code>, <code>must_be_proper_list/3</code>,
<code>must_be_var/3</code>, and
<code>proper_list/1</code> are new in this release.

     <br><dt><code>library(update)</code>
     <dd>provides utilities for updating "database"
relations.

     <br><dt><code>library(vectors)</code>
     <dd>
The Quintus Prolog foreign code interface provides means of
        passing scalars between Prolog and C, FORTRAN, Pascal, etc.

     <p><code>library(vectors)</code> provides routines
        you can use to pass one-dimensional numeric arrays between
        Prolog and C, Pascal, or FORTRAN. 
        See the comments in the code.  Briefly,
          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>list_to_vector(</code><var>+ListOfNumbers</var><code>, </code><var>+Type</var><code>, </code><var>-Vector</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
    creates a vector, which you can pass to C.  C will
    declare the argument as <var>Type*</var>, and Prolog will
    declare the argument as <code>+address(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>. 
    FORTRAN will declare the argument as an array of <var>Type</var>.

          <br><dt><code>make_vector(</code><var>+Size</var><code>, </code><var>+Type</var><code>, </code><var>-Vector</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
    creates a vector, which the foreign routine is to fill
    in.  C will declare the argument as <var>Type*</var>, and Prolog will
    declare the argument as <code>+address(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>. 
    FORTRAN will declare the argument as an array of <var>Type</var>.

          <br><dt><code>vector_to_list(</code><var>+Vector</var><code>, </code><var>?List</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
    extracts the elements of the <var>Vector</var> as a list of
    numbers; if the <var>Vector</var> contains chars or ints, the
    <var>List</var> will contain integers, otherwise it will contain
    floating-point numbers.

          <br><dt><code>kill_vector(</code><var>+Vector</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
    frees a vector.  Don't forget to do this!  You can still
    call <code>vector_to_list/2</code> on a dead vector, until the next time
    memory is allocated.  All that you can really rely on is
    that it is safe to create some vectors, call a C routine,
    kill all the vectors, and then extract the contents of
    the interesting ones before doing anything else. 
</dl>

     <br><dt><code>library(writetokens)</code>
     <dd>This package converts a term to a list of tokens. 
This is essentially the same as the public-domain <code>write.pl</code>, except that
instead of writing characters to the current output stream, it returns
a list of tokens.  There are three kinds of tokens: punctuation marks,
constants, and atoms.  There is nothing to indicate spacing; the point
of this package is to let the caller do such formatting.

     <br><dt><code>library(xml)</code>
     <dd>is a package for parsing XML with Prolog, which
provides Prolog applications with a simple "Document Value Model"
interface to XML documents.
