                          <var>-AbsFileName</var>)

   <p><code>absolute_file_name</code>(<var>+RelFileSpec</var>,

                          <var>*AbsFileName</var>)

   <p>Unifies <var>AbsFileName</var> with the the absolute filename
that corresponds to the relative file specification <var>RelFileSpec</var>.

<h4 class="subheading">Arguments</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><var>RelFileSpec</var> <dfn>file_spec</dfn>
     <dd>A valid file specification.

     <br><dt><var>AbsFileName</var> <dfn>atom</dfn>
     <dd>The first absolute filename
derived from <var>RelFileSpec</var> that satisfies the access modes given
by <var>Options</var>.

     <br><dt><var>Options</var> <dfn>list</dfn>
     <dd>A list of zero or more of the following:

          <dl>

          <br><dt><code>ignore_underscores(</code><var>Bool</var><code>)</code>
          <dd><var>Bool</var> =
               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>true</code>
               <dd>When constructing an absolute
filename that matches the given access modes, two names are tried:
First the absolute filename derived directly from <var>RelFileSpec</var>, and
then the filename obtained by first deleting all underscores from
<var>RelFileSpec</var>.

               <br><dt><code>false</code>
               <dd>(default) Suppresses any deletion of underscores. 
</dl>

          <br><dt><code>extensions(</code><var>Ext</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>
 Has no effect if
<var>RelFileSpec</var> contains a file extension.  <var>Ext</var> is an atom
or a list of
atoms, each atom representing an extension that should be tried when
constructing the absolute filename.  The extensions are tried in the
order they appear in the list.  Default value is <var>Ext</var> = <code>['']</code>,
i.e. only the given <var>RelFileSpec</var> is tried, no extension is
added. To specify <code>extensions('')</code> or <code>extensions([])</code> is
equal to not giving any extensions option at all.

          <br><dt><code>file_type(</code><var>Type</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>Has no effect if <var>RelFileSpec</var>
contains a file extension.  Picks an adequate extension for
the operating system currently running, which means that programs
using this option instead of <code>extensions(</code><var>Ext</var><code>)</code> will be more portable
between operating systems.  <var>Type</var> must be one of the following atoms:
               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>text</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions([''])</code>. 
<br>

               <p><var>RelFileSpec</var> is a file without any extension.  (Default)

               <br><dt><code>prolog</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions(['pl',''])</code>. 
<br>

               <p><var>RelFileSpec</var> is a Prolog source file, maybe with a <code>.pl</code> extension.

               <br><dt><code>object</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions(['o',''])</code>
<br>

               <p>(substitute the actual object file extension for <code>o</code>)
<var>RelFileSpec</var> is a foreign language object file, maybe
with an extension.

               <br><dt><code>executable</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions(['so',''])</code>
<br>

               <p>(substitute the actual shared object file extension for <code>so</code>)
<var>RelFileSpec</var> is a foreign executable (shared object file), maybe
with an extension.

               <br><dt><code>qof</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions(['qof',''])</code>. 
<br>

               <p><var>RelFileSpec</var> is a Prolog object code file, maybe with a <code>.qof</code>
extension.

               <br><dt><code>directory</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions([''])</code>. 
<br>

               <p><var>RelFileSpec</var> is a directory, not a regular file. Only when this
option is present can <code>absolute_file_name/3</code> access directories
without raising an exception.

               <br><dt><code>foreign</code>
               <dd>implies <code>extensions(['o',''])</code>
<br>

               <p>(substitute the actual object file extension for <code>o</code>)
Same as <code>object</code>. Included for backward compatibility. Might be removed
from future releases. 
</dl>

          <br><dt><code>ignore_version(</code><var>Bool</var><code>)</code>
          <dd>    This switch has no effect
on systems where files don't have version numbers. <var>Bool</var> =

               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>true</code>
               <dd>When looking for a file that
obeys the specified access modes, the version numbers will be ignored. 
The returned absolute filename will not contain any version number. 
To find a filename that includes a proper version number, use
<code>absolute_file_name/3</code> with the returned file as input, and
the option <code>ignore_version(false</code>).

               <p>See description of <code>access</code> option.

               <br><dt><code>false</code>
               <dd>(default) Version numbers are significant.

          </dl>

          <br><dt><code>access(</code><var>Mode</var><code>)</code>
          <dd><var>Mode</var> must be one of the following:

               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>read</code>
               <dd><var>AbsFileName</var> must be readable.

               <br><dt><code>write</code>
               <dd>If <var>AbsFileName</var> exists, it must be
writable.  If it doesn't exist, it must be possible to create.

               <br><dt><code>append</code>
               <dd>If <var>AbsFileName</var> exists, it must be
writable.  If it doesn't exist, it must be possible to create.

               <br><dt><code>exist</code>
               <dd>The file represented by <var>AbsFileName</var> must exist.

               <br><dt><code>none</code>
               <dd>(default) The file
system is not accessed. The first absolute filename that is derived
from <var>RelFileSpec</var> is returned. Note that if this option is
specified, no existence exceptions can be raised.

               <br><dt>list of access modes
               <dd>A list of one or more of the above
options. If <var>AbsFile</var> exists, it must obey every specified option
in the list. This makes it possible to combine a read and write, or
write and exist check, into one call to <code>absolute_file_name/3</code>.

          </dl>
<br><dt>
          <dd>
<strong>Please note:</strong> The following only applies to file systems with version
numbered files.  If the user explicitly has specified a version number,
only that version is considered. If no version number is supplied, the
version number of <var>AbsFileName</var> is determined by:

               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>read</code>
               <dd>newest readable version.

               <br><dt><code>write</code>
               <dd>the file exists, the newest version
plus one. If the file doesn't exist, a system dependent "youngest"
version number.

               <br><dt><code>append</code>
               <dd>If the file exists, the newest version. 
If the file doesn't exist, a system dependent "youngest"
version number.

               <dd>newest version.

               <br><dt><code>none</code>
               <dd>A system dependent "youngest"
version number. Note that this can
be switched of with the <code>ignore_version</code> option.

               <br><dt>list of modes
               <dd>newest version. 
</dl>

          <br><dt><code>file_errors(</code><var>Val</var><code>)</code>
          <dd><var>Val</var> =
               <dl>

               <br><dt><code>error</code>
               <dd>(default) Raise an exception if a file derived from <var>RelFileSpec</var>
has the wrong permissions, that is, can't be accessed at all, or doesn't
satisfy the the access modes specified with the <code>access</code> option.

               <br><dt><code>fail</code>
               <dd>Fail if a file derived from <var>RelFileSpec</var> has the wrong
permissions. Normally an exception is raised, which
might not always be a desirable
behavior, since files that do obey the access options might
be found later on in the search.  When this option is given, the search
space is guaranteed to be exhausted. Note that the effect of this option
is the same as having the Prolog flag <code>fileerrors</code> set to <code>off</code>. 
</dl>

               <br><dt><code>first</code>
               <dd>(default) As soon as a file derived from <var>RelFileSpec</var> is found,
commit to that file. Makes <code>absolute_file_name/3</code> determinate.

               <br><dt><code>all</code>
               <dd>Return each file derived from <var>RelFileSpec</var> that is found. The files
are returned through backtracking. This option is probably most useful in
combination with the option <code>file_errors(fail)</code>.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Description</h4>

   <p>We can restrict our description to <code>absolute_file_name/3</code>, because
<code>absolute_file_name/2</code> can be defined as:
<pre class="example">     absolute_file_name(RelFileSpec, AbsFileName) :-
        Options = [ ignore_underscores(true),
                    file_type(prolog),
                    access(exist),
                    file_errors(fail) ],
        (  absolute_file_name(RelFileSpec,
                              Options,
                              AbsFileName)
        -&gt; true
        ;  absolute_file_name(RelFileSpec,
                              [],
                              AbsFileName)
        ).
     </pre>

   <p>Note that the semantics of <code>absolute_file_name/2</code> has changed slightly since
previous releases. The difference is that <code>absolute_file_name/2</code> now always
succeeds and returns an absolute filename, also when the <var>RelFileSpec</var> is
a compound
term. For instance, if the relative filename is <code>library(strings)</code>,
you get an absolute filename, even if the library file <code>strings.pl</code>
doesn't exist. In previous releases, this would have raised an exception. 
If it's important that an error is raised when the file doesn't exist,
<code>absolute_file_name/3</code> with option <code>access(exist)</code> can be used.

   <p><b>Four phase process:</b> The functionality of <code>absolute_file_name/3</code>
is most easily described as a four phase process, in which each phase
gets an infile from the preceding phase, and constructs one or more
outfiles to be consumed by the succeeding phases. The phases are:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li> Syntactic rewriting
<li>Underscore deletion
<li>Extension expansion
<li>Access checking
        </ol>

   <p>Each of the three first phases modifies the infile and produces variants that
will be fed into the succeeding phases. The functionality of all phases
but the first are decided with the option list. The last phase checks if
the generated file exists, and if not asks for a new variant from the
preceding phases.  If the file exists, but doesn't obey the access
mode option, a permission exception is raised. If the file
obeys the access mode option,
<code>absolute_file_name/3</code> commits to that solution, unifies
<var>AbsFileName</var> with the filename, and succeeds determinately. For a
thorough description, see below.

   <p>Note that the relative filename <var>RelFileSpec</var>
may also be of the form PathAlias(<var>FileSpec</var>),
in which case the absolute filename of the file <var>FileSpec</var> in
one of the directories designated by <var>PathAlias</var> is returned
(see the description of each phase below, and
 <a href="ref-fdi-fsp.html#ref-fdi-fsp">ref-fdi-fsp</a>).

<h4 class="subheading">Description of each phase</h4>

   <p>(Phase 1) This phase translates the relative file specification given by
<var>RelFileSpec</var> into the corresponding absolute filename.

   <p>If <var>RelFileSpec</var> is a term with one argument, it is interpreted as
PathAlias(<var>FileSpec</var>) and outfile becomes the file
as given by <code>file_search_path/2</code>. 
  If
<code>file_search_path/2</code> has more than one solution, outfile is unified
with the solutions in the order they are generated.  If the succeeding
phase fails, and there is no more solutions, an existence exception is
raised.

   <p>If <var>RelFileSpec</var> = <code>''</code>, outfile is unified with the current
working directory. 
If <code>absolute_file_name/3</code> is called from a goal in a file being loaded,
the directory containing that file is considered current working
directory.  If the succeeding phase fails, an existence exception is
raised.

   <p>If <var>RelFileSpec</var> is an atom, other than <code>''</code>, it's divided into components. 
A component are defined to be those characters:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Between the beginning of the filename and the end of the filename
if there are no <code>/</code>s in the filename. 
<li>Between the beginning of the filename and the first <code>/</code>. 
<li>Between any two successive <code>/</code>-groups (where a <code>/</code>-group is defined to be
a sequence of one or more <code>/</code>s with no non-<code>/</code> character interspersed.) 
<li>Between the last <code>/</code> and the end of the filename.
        </ol>

   <p>To give the absolute filename, the following rules are applied to
each component of <var>RelFileSpec</var>:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>        The component <code>~</code><var>user</var><code></code>, if encountered as the first component
           of <var>RelFileSpec</var>, is replaced by the absolute name
           of the home directory of <var>user</var>. If <var>user</var> doesn't exist,
           a permission exception is raised. 
<li>        The component <code>~</code>, if encountered as the first component
           of <var>RelFileSpec</var>, is replaced by the absolute name
           of the home directory of the current user. 
<li>        If neither (1) nor (2) applies, then <var>RelFileSpec</var>
           is prefixed with the current working directory. If
           <code>absolute_file_name/3</code> is called from a goal in a file being
           loaded, the directory containing that file is considered current
           working directory. 
<li>        The component <code>.</code> is deleted. 
<li>        The component <code>..</code> is deleted together with the directory name
           syntactically preceding it. For example, <code>a/b/../c</code> is
           rewritten as <code>a/c</code>. 
<li>        Two or more consecutive <code>/</code>s are replaced with one <code>/</code>.
        </ol>

   <p>When these rules have been applied, the absolute filename is unified
with outfile. If the succeeding phase fails, an existence exception is
raised.

   <p>(Phase 2) See <code>ignore_underscores</code> option.

   <p>(Phase 3) See <code>extensions</code> and <code>file_type</code> options.

   <p>(Phase 4) See <code>access</code> option.

<h4 class="subheading">Exceptions</h4>

     <dl>

     <br><dt><code>domain_error</code>
     <dd>
   <var>Options</var> contains an undefined option.

     <br><dt><code>instantiation_error</code>
     <dd>
    Any of the <var>Options</var> arguments or <var>RelFileSpec</var>
is not ground.

     <br><dt><code>type_error</code>
     <dd>
   In <var>Options</var> or in <var>RelFileSpec</var>.

     <br><dt><code>existence_error</code>
     <dd>
   <var>RelFileSpec</var> is syntactically valid but does not correspond to any file.

     <br><dt><code>permission_error</code>
     <dd>
   <var>RelFileSpec</var> names an existing file but the file does not obey the given access mode.

   </dl>

<h4 class="subheading">Comments</h4>

   <p>If an option is specified more than once the rightmost option takes
precedence. This provides for a convenient way of adding default
values by putting these defaults at the front of the list of options.

   <p>Note that the default behavior of <code>absolute_file_name/3</code>, that is
when <var>Options</var> = <code>[]</code>, does not
mimic the behavior of <code>absolute_file_name/2</code>.

   <p>If <code>absolute_file_name/3</code> succeeds, and the file access option was one
of {read, write, append}, it is guaranteed that the file can be
opened with <code>open/[3,4]</code>.  If the access option was <code>exist</code>, the file
does exist, but might be both read and write protected.

   <p>Note that <code>absolute_file_name/3</code> signals a permission error if a specified
file refers to a directory (unless the option <code>access(none)</code> is given.)

   <p><code>absolute_file_name/[2,3]</code> is sensitive to the <code>fileerrors</code>
flag, which causes the predicate to fail rather than raising permission errors
when reading files with wrong permission.  This has the effect that the search
space always is exhausted.

   <p>directives
in the extensions list. This causes the so specified access mode to be used
as default access mode from there on, and the subsequently generated file
names will thus be tried for this access mode, and not the default set by
the access option. This can be particularly useful when used in combination
with the <code>fileerrors</code> flag mentioned above. 
}

   <p>If <var>RelFileSpec</var> contains a <code>..</code> component, the constructed
absolute filename might be wrong. This occurs if the parent directory
is not the same as the directory preceding <code>..</code> in the relative file
name, which only can happen if a soft link is involved.

<h4 class="subheading">Examples</h4>

   <p>To check whether the file <code>my_text</code> exists in the
current user directory, with one of the extensions <code>text</code> or <code>txt</code>, and is
both writable and readable:

<pre class="example">     absolute_file_name('~/my_text',
                        [extensions(['text','txt']),
                         access([read,write])],
                        File).
     </pre>

   <p>To check if the Prolog file <code>same_functor</code> exists in some library,
and also check if it exists under the name <code>samefunctor</code>:
<pre class="example">     absolute_file_name(library(same_functor),
                        [file_type(prolog), access(exist),
                         ignore_underscores(true)],
                        File).
