<h4 class="subsection">Passing Pointers</h4>

   <p>Pointers should be passed through the foreign interface using the
specification
<pre class="example">     address(<var>typename</var>)
     </pre>
     They could also be
passed as integers, but there are two added advantages for using the
address specification. 
The first is that a stand-alone tool
 could
check for consistency between the foreign declarations and the foreign code. 
The second advantage is for possible optimizations on platforms
whose pointers require more than 29 bits.

   <p>The <var>typename</var>
is there so that a stand-alone tool could know
 what kind of argument to pass or what
kind of result to demand and  <var>typename</var> should be the name used
in the foreign language to identify the type of object named by the pointer. 
It is sufficiently important  to be able to check the
<code>foreign/3</code> declarations that Prolog will issue a warning if the
<var>typename</var> is not an atom, but it makes no other use of the <var>typename</var>. 
The <var>typename</var> can even be omitted entirely,
using <code>address</code> as an argument specification.

   <p>is the argument type desired.]

   <p>Note that programs should not rely
on numeric relations between foreign language pointers being true of the
Prolog integers to which they are converted.

   <p>See <a href="fli-p2f-fex-poi.html#fli-p2f-fex-poi">fli-p2f-fex-poi</a> for an example of passing pointers
through the foreign interface.  For further examples, see <code>library(charsio)</code> and
<code>library(vectors)</code>.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +address(<var>typename</var>)
     C:       <var>typename</var> *x
     Pascal:  type ptr = ^typename;
              x: ptr
     FORTRAN: typename x(*)
     </pre>

   <p>The argument must be instantiated to an integer, otherwise the call
   fails.  If the argument is 0, the foreign function will receive the NULL
   pointer. 
   Otherwise the argument will be converted to a pointer.  The coding
   is system-dependent.  All you can rely on is that NULL and "<code>malloc()</code>
   pointers" can be passed from the foreign language to Prolog and that Prolog
   can then pass the same pointers back to the foreign language.

   <p>FORTRAN programmers will note that <code>+address(integer)</code> and <code>+address(float)</code>
   parameters are useful for passing arrays to FORTRAN, but since
   FORTRAN has no pointer data type (and no equivalent of <code>malloc(3)</code>), address
   results are not possible.  Therefore arrays cannot be constructed in
   FORTRAN and then passed to Prolog;  they must be constructed in C or
   Pascal.  <a href="fli-p2f-fex-poi.html#fli-p2f-fex-poi">fli-p2f-fex-poi</a> gives an example where arrays are
   constructed in C and later passed to a FORTRAN routine.

   <p>The <var>typename</var> must be an atom, but is otherwise ignored by Prolog. 
   It is present for the benefit of stand-alone tools, which could check

   <p>that your Prolog
   <code>foreign/3</code> facts are compatible with your C source files.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -address(<var>typename</var>)
     C:       <var>typename</var> **x;
              *x = ...
     Pascal:  type ptr = ^typename;
              var x: ptr;
              x = ...
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a pointer is passed to the foreign function.  It is assumed
   that the function will overwrite this variable with the result it wishes to
   return.  This result should be either the NULL pointer or a <code>malloc()</code>
   pointer.  When the function returns, the
   result is converted to a Prolog integer, which is then
   unified with the corresponding argument of the Prolog call.  The
   argument can be of any type; if it cannot be unified with the
   returned integer, the call fails.  If the foreign function does
   not set the result, the result is undefined.

   <p>The <var>typename</var> must be an atom, but is otherwise ignored by Prolog. 
   It is present for the benefit of stand-alone tools, which could check

   <p>that your Prolog
   <code>foreign/3</code> facts are compatible with your C source files.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  [-address(<var>typename</var>)]
     C:       <var>typename</var> *f(...)
                {
                   <var>typename</var> *x;
                   return x;
                }
     Pascal:  type ptr = ^typename;
              function f(...): ptr;
                var x: ptr;
                begin
                  f := x;
                end
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>No argument is passed to the foreign function. 
   The return value from the foreign function is
   assumed to be a pointer to an object of the type indicated by
   <var>typename</var>.  This pointer should be either NULL or a <code>malloc()</code> pointer. 
   It is converted to a Prolog integer, which
   is then unified with the corresponding argument of the Prolog
   call.  The argument can be of any type; if it cannot be unified with
   the returned integer, the call fails.

   <p>The <var>typename</var> must be an atom, but is otherwise ignored by Prolog. 
   It is present for the benefit of stand-alone tools, which could check

   <p>that your Prolog
   <code>foreign/3</code> facts are compatible with your C source files.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +address
     C:       char *x
     Pascal:  type charp = ^char;
              x: charp
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>This is equivalent to <code>+address(char)</code> (see
<code>+address(</code><var>typename</var><code>)</code> above).  Note that <code>+address(char)</code> is not
useful in FORTRAN because FORTRAN will not accept a pointer to a
character array as representing that array.  Therefore <code>+address</code> is not
allowed in FORTRAN.  To pass a character array to FORTRAN use the
<code>+string(</code><var>N</var><code>)</code> argument type as described in
<a href="fli-p2f-atm-spf.html#fli-p2f-atm-spf">fli-p2f-atm-spf</a>.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -address
     C:       char **x
              *x = ...
     Pascal:  type charp = ^char;
              var x: charp;
              x = ...
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>This is equivalent to <code>-address(char)</code> (see <code>-address(</code><var>typename</var><code>)</code> above).

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  [-address]
     C:       char *f(...)
                {
                  char *x;
                  return x;
                }
     Pascal:  type charp = ^char;
              function f(...): charp;
                var x: charp;
                begin
                  f := x;
                end
     FORTRAN: Not supported
     </pre>

   <p>This is equivalent to <code>[-address(char)]</code> (see
   <code>[-address(</code><var>typename</var><code>)]</code> above).
