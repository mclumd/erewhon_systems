<h4 class="subsection">Overview</h4>

   <p>The purpose of this manual is to provide a complete description of the
Quintus Prolog system.  It is not necessary to read the entire manual before
starting to use Quintus Prolog.  On the contrary, it is organized so that you
should be able to quickly find out whatever you need to know about the
system.

   <p>Start by reading Chapter 1. 
<a href="int-hig.html#int-hig">int-hig</a> provides an overview of all the new
functionality and includes references to places where this new
functionality is documented. 
<a href="int-dir.html#int-dir">int-dir</a>
provides an overview of the installation hierarchy, which will be
helpful in orienting you at many points in the manual.

   <p>Familiarity with some form of Prolog programming is assumed, at least
at the level of textbooks such as those listed at the end of this
chapter.  It is the particular syntax, semantics and functionality of
Quintus Prolog that is treated here.  The material in the first 10 chapters is meant to
introduce you to Quintus Prolog, not Prolog in general.

   <p>The entire manual is accessible on-line as discussed in
<a href="ref-olh.html#ref-olh">ref-olh</a>, and, for Quintus User Interface users,
<a href="qui-hlp.html#qui-hlp">qui-hlp</a>.  This facility allows you to access the manual
directly from Prolog whenever you need to look something up.

   <p>The manual, printed and on-line, is supplemented by various on-line
resources including tutorials, demos, and code comments in library
packages.  See <a href="int-dir.html#int-dir">int-dir</a> for the location of
these materials in the Quintus Directory.
