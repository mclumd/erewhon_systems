<h5 class="subsubsection">Looking Up a Callable Prolog Predicate</h5>

   <p>Before a Prolog predicate can be called from a foreign language it
must be looked up.  The C functions <code>QP_predicate()</code> and
<code>QP_pred()</code> perform this function.  The lookup step could have been
folded into the functions that make the query, but if a predicate was
to be called many times the redundant, if hidden, predicate lookup
would be a source of unnecessary overhead.  Instead,
<code>QP_predicate()</code> or <code>QP_pred()</code> can be called just once per
predicate.  The result can then be stored in a variable and used as
necessary.

   <p>Both <code>QP_predicate()</code> and <code>QP_pred</code> return a <code>QP_pred_ref</code>, which
represents a Prolog predicate.  The type definition for <code>QP_pred_ref</code>
is found in <code>&lt;quintus/quintus.h&gt;</code>.

<pre class="example">            QP_pred_ref QP_predicate(name_string, arity, module_string)
            char *name_string;
            long int arity;
            char *module_string;
     </pre>

   <p><code>QP_predicate()</code> is the most convenient way of looking up a
callable Prolog predicate.  It is simply passed the name and module
of the predicate to be called as strings, the arity as an integer, and
returns a <code>QP_pred_ref</code>, which is used to make the actual call to Prolog.

   <p><code>QP_predicate()</code> can only be used to look up predicates that have
been declared callable from foreign code.  If some other predicate is
looked up, <code>QP_ERROR</code> is returned.  Checking the return value protects
you from attempting to call a predicate that isn't yet ready to be
called.

<pre class="example">            QP_pred_ref QP_pred(name_atom, arity, module_atom)
            QP_atom name_atom;
            long int arity;
            QP_atom module_atom;
     </pre>

   <p><code>QP_pred()</code> is a less convenient, but faster, means of looking up a
callable Prolog predicate.  Unlike <code>QP_predicate()</code>, it has its name
and module arguments passed as Prolog atoms.  These may have been
returned to C from Prolog, or may have been built in the foreign
language using <code>QP_atom_from_string()</code>.  One additional difference
is that the name passed is <em>not</em> the name of the Prolog predicate to be
called, but rather the name of the interface predicate constructed
when the Prolog predicate was made callable from foreign code
<a href="fli-ffp-ppc.html#fli-ffp-ppc">fli-ffp-ppc</a>.  Much of the cost of <code>QP_predicate()</code> is from having
to look up Prolog atoms for its name and module arguments.  By
avoiding doing this unnecessarily, what <code>QP_pred()</code> gives up in
convenience is returned in performance.  Like <code>QP_predicate()</code>,
<code>QP_pred()</code> returns a <code>QP_pred_ref</code>, which is used to make the
actual call to Prolog.  If a predicate that is not an interface
predicate is looked up, <code>QP_pred()</code> returns <code>QP_ERROR</code>.

   <p><code>QP_pred()</code> can only be used to look up predicates that
have been declared callable from foreign code.  If some other predicate,
or a predicate that does not exist, is looked up, <code>QP_ERROR</code> is returned. 
This protects you from attempting to call a predicate that
isn't yet ready to be called.
