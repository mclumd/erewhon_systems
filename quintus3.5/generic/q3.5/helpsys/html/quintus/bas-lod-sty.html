<h4 class="subsection">Style Warnings</h4>

   <p>In addition to checking for syntax errors, Quintus Prolog also
has a style checker, which displays warning messages whenever
certain stylistic conventions are violated in a program.  Whereas
syntax error messages indicate clauses that cannot be read into Prolog,
style warnings simply indicate possible typing
mistakes, or program construction that doesn't follow Quintus Prolog
style conventions. 
The style conventions for Quintus Prolog are listed below.  If you adhere
to these conventions, you can use the style warnings to catch
simple errors very easily.

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>Define all clauses for a given procedure in one file.  This is
essential; the load predicates do not allow the definition of a
procedure to be spread across more than one file unless the procedure
is declared multifile -- see <code>multifile/1</code> for more
information on this.  If a non-multifile procedure is defined in more
than one file, and all the files in which the procedure is defined are
compiled, each definition of the procedure in a new file will wipe out
any clauses for the procedure that were defined in previous files. 
<li>Make all clauses for a given procedure contiguous in the source file.  This
doesn't mean that you should avoid leaving blank space or putting comments
between clauses, but simply that clauses for one procedure should
not be interspersed with clauses for another procedure. 
<li>If a variable appears only once in a clause, either write that
variable as the single character <code>_</code> (the void variable), or begin the
variable name with the character <code>_</code>.
        </ol>

   <p>If any of these conditions are not met, you will be warned
when the file containing the offending clauses is compiled.

   <p>If style convention 1 is violated, Prolog displays a message like
the one shown below before it compiles each procedure that has
been defined in another file that has already been loaded:
<pre class="example">     * Procedure foo/2 is being redefined in a different file -
     *    Previous file: /ufs/george/file1
     *    New file:      /ufs/george/file2
     * Do you really want to redefine it? (y,n,p,s, or ?)
     </pre>

   <p>If you type <kbd>y</kbd>, the definition in the file currently being loaded
replaces the existing procedure definition.  If you type <kbd>n</kbd>, the
existing definition remains intact, and the definition in the file currently
being loaded is ignored.  If you type <kbd>p</kbd> (for <b>p</b>roceed), the
definition in the file currently being loaded replaces the
existing definition; furthermore, the remaining procedure definitions
in the file
<code>/ufs/george/file2</code>
will automatically replace any existing definitions made by the file
<code>/ufs/george/file1</code>
without displaying any warning messages. 
If you type <kbd>s</kbd> (for <b>s</b>uppress), the
existing definition remains intact and the definition in the file
currently being loaded is ignored; furthermore, the remaining procedure
definitions in the file
<code>/ufs/george/file2</code>
which attempt to replace definitions made by the file
<code>/ufs/george/file1</code>
will be ignored without displaying any warning messages. 
(These options are particularly useful if
you have changed the name or location of a file, since it
suppresses the warnings you
would otherwise get for every procedure in the file.)  If you type <kbd>?</kbd>,
Prolog displays a message that briefly describes each of the options above,
and then asks you again if you want to redefine the procedure.

   <p>If style convention 2 is violated, you will get a message of the form:
<pre class="example">     * Clauses for foo/2 are not together in the source file
     </pre>

   <p>This indicates that between some pair of clauses defining
procedure <code>foo/2</code>, there is a clause for some other procedure.  If
you followed the style conventions in writing your code, this
message would indicate that some clause in your source file had
either a mistyped name or the wrong arity, or that the predicate <code>foo/2</code>
was defined more than once in the file.  One other possible cause for this
message might be that a period was typed in place of a comma, as in
<pre class="example">     foo(X, Y) :-
        goal1(X, Z),
        goal2(Z).
        goal3(X, Y).
     foo([], []).
     </pre>

   <p>Here the Prolog system will think that you are defining a clause for <code>goal3/2</code>
between the clauses for <code>foo/2</code>, and will issue a style warning.

   <p>If style convention 3 is violated, as in
<pre class="example">     check_state(TheState):-
        old_state(TheStaye, X),
        write(TheState),
        write(X).
     </pre>

   <p>you will get a message of the form:
<pre class="example">     * Singleton variables, clause 1 of check_state/1: TheStaye
     </pre>

   <p>indicating that in the first clause of procedure <code>check_state/1</code>, there is
only one occurrence of the variable TheStaye.  If that variable is a
misspelling, you should correct the source text and recompile. 
If it was really meant to be a single variable occurrence, replace it with
the anonymous variable <code>_</code> or preface it with <code>_</code> as in <code>_TheStaye</code>, and
you will no longer get the style warning message.

   <p>It is good programming practice to respond immediately to these
warnings by correcting the source text.  By doing so, you will
get the full benefit of the style warning facility in finding
many errors painlessly.

   <p>By default, all the style warning facilities are turned on.  You can turn
off any or all of the style warning facilities by typing
<kbd>no_style_check(</kbd><var>X</var><kbd>).</kbd> at the main Prolog prompt, where <var>X</var>
represents one of the arguments listed below.  To turn on style warning
facilities, type <kbd>style_check(</kbd><var>X</var><kbd>).</kbd> at the main Prolog prompt,
where <var>X</var> represents one of the arguments listed below.

     <dl>

     <br><dt><b>Argument</b>
     <dd><b>Function</b>

     <br><dt><code>all</code>
     <dd>turns on (or off) all style checking

     <br><dt><code>single_var</code>
     <dd>turns on (or off) checking for single variable occurrences

     <br><dt><code>discontiguous</code>
     <dd>turns on (or off) checking for discontiguous
clauses for procedures

     <br><dt><code>multiple</code>
     <dd>turns on (or off) style checking for multiple
definitions of same procedures (in different files)

   </dl>

   <p>For example, to turn off all the style warning facilities, you would type
<pre class="example">     | ?- <kbd>no_style_check(all).</kbd>
     </pre>
