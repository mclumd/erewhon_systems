<h5 class="subsubsection">The Spypoint Menu</h5>

   <p>The Spypoint menu allows you to set spypoints in your code by selecting
the goal to be spied with the mouse, thereby highlighting the goal, and
then selecting a spy command (see <a href="dbg-bas-tra-spy.html#dbg-bas-tra-spy">dbg-bas-tra-spy</a> for an explanation
of spypoints).  You may add or remove spypoints from goals or predicates
this way.

<pre class="example">                           +-----------------+
                           | Spy Goal        |
                           +-----------------+
                           | Nospy Goal      |
                           +-----------------+
                           | Spy Predicate   |
                           +-----------------+
                           | Nospy Predicate |
                           +-----------------+
     </pre>

<div align="center">Selecting The Spypoints Menu</div>

   <p>Selecting the <b>Spy Goal</b> command will place a spypoint on the
currently selected goal, and selecting <b>Nospy Goal</b> will remove the
spypoint.  Selecting the <b>Spy Predicate</b> command will place a
spypoint on the predicate for which a goal (or clause head) is
currently selected, and <b>Nospy Predicate</b> will remove the spypoint. 
The difference between goal and predicate spypoints is that a spypoint
on a predicate will stop the debugger regardless of how that predicate
is called, while a goal spypoint will only stop when the predicate is
called from that particular goal.

   <p>When a spypoint is placed on a goal, a small stop-sign is placed before
that goal in the debugger window, indicating that it is spied. 
Similarly, when a predicate is spied, a stop-sign is placed before the
first clause for that predicate.
