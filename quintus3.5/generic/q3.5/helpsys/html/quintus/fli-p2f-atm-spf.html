<h5 class="subsubsection">Passing Atoms as Strings to/from Pascal or FORTRAN</h5>

   <p>This section describes passing atoms as pointers to fixed-length, blank-padded
arrays of characters.  This is the way to pass atoms as strings between Prolog
and Pascal or FORTRAN.  See <a href="fli-p2f-atm-spc.html#fli-p2f-atm-spc">fli-p2f-atm-spc</a> for how to pass atoms
as null-terminated strings between Prolog and C.

   <blockquote>

        <p><strong>Implementation note:</strong>  The foreign interface makes some assumptions about how
string parameters are handled in Pascal and FORTRAN compilers.  If a given
Pascal or FORTRAN compiler has different conventions for the handling of string
parameters, the interface will not work.  The conventions are:
          <ul>

          <li>A string result is represented by a pointer to the character array followed by
its size.  These two values are passed before all the other arguments. 
<li>Other string parameters are also represented by a pointer to the characters and
a size.  In this case the pointer occupies the normal position in the argument
list, and the size is passed after all the other arguments. 
</ul>

   </blockquote>

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  +string(<var>N</var>)
     C:       Not supported
     Pascal:  type string<var>N</var> = packed array [1..<var>N</var>] of char;
              var x: string<var>N</var>
     FORTRAN: character*<var>N</var>
     </pre>

   <p>The argument must be instantiated to an atom, otherwise the call will signal
an error. 
A character array, containing a copy of the characters of the atom, is passed
by reference to the function.  The text is truncated on the right
or padded on the right with blanks to length <var>N</var>.

   <p>Note that the Pascal parameter is call-by-reference (var), the same as
for the <code>-string(</code><var>N</var><code>)</code> case below.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  -string(<var>N</var>)
     C:       Not supported
     Pascal:  type string<var>N</var> = packed array [1..<var>N</var>] of char;
              var x: string<var>N</var>
     FORTRAN: character*<var>N</var>
     </pre>

   <p>A pointer to a character array of length <var>N</var>, initialized to all
blanks, is passed to the function.  It is assumed that the function will
fill in this array.  When the function returns, the atom that has
   the printed representation specified by the character array is unified
   with the corresponding argument of the Prolog call.

   <p>Trailing blanks in the character array are ignored.  Thus if the
   foreign function sets a character array of length 6 to <code>atom  </code>,
   Prolog will convert the result to the atom <code>atom</code>.  Leading blanks are
   significant:  if the foreign function returns <code> this </code>, the resulting
   atom is <code>' this'</code>.

   <p>The argument can
   be of any type; if it cannot be unified with the returned atom, then
   the call fails.  If the function does not fill in the character
   array, then the result is the null atom <code>''</code>.

<pre class="example">     Prolog:  [-string(<var>N</var>)]
     C:       Not supported
     Pascal:  Not Supported
     FORTRAN: character*<var>N</var> function
     </pre>

   <p>This argument specification is valid only for FORTRAN.  The FORTRAN function
result is initialized to a blank-filled character array of length <var>N</var>.  It
is assumed that the function will fill this array. 
The atom that has the printed representation specified by the character
array is unified with the corresponding argument of the Prolog call.

   <p>Trailing blanks in the character array are ignored, as for
the <code>-string(</code><var>N</var><code>)</code> case above.

   <p>The argument can be of any type; if it cannot be unified with the returned
atom, then the call fails.  If the function does not fill in the character
array, then the result is the null atom <code>''</code>.
