<h5 class="subsubsection">Overview</h5>

   <p>One of the more difficult things to master when learning Prolog is the
proper use of the cut.  Often, when beginners find unexpected
backtracking occurring in their programs, they try to prevent it by
inserting cuts in a rather random fashion.  This makes the programs
harder to understand and sometimes stops them from working.

   <p>During program development, each predicate in a program should be
considered <em>independently</em> to determine whether or not it should be
able to succeed more than once.  In most applications, many predicates
should at most, succeed only once; that is, they should be <em>determinate</em>. 
Having decided that a predicate should be determinate, it should be
verified that, in fact, it is.  The debugger can help in verifying that
a predicate is determinate (see <a href="dbg-bas-upe.html#dbg-bas-upe">dbg-bas-upe</a>).
