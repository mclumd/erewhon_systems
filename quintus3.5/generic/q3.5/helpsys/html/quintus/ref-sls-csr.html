<h4 class="subsection">Compatibility with save/restore in previous releases</h4>

   <p>Unfortunately, it has not been possible to retain the semantics of
<code>save/[1,2]</code> available in previous releases of Quintus Prolog.  This is
regrettable because it means that programs that incorporate code for
building saved-states will need to be changed.  This section explains why it
was necessary to remove these predicates.  Note, however, that
<code>save_program/1</code> <em>is</em> available and has the same semantics as previous
releases (except for foreign code), although it is based on a new
implementation using QOF files. A new predicate <code>save_program/2</code>,
described in <a href="ref-sls-sst.html#ref-sls-sst">ref-sls-sst</a>, has been provided, which supports the
most common usage of <code>save/[1,2]</code>, which was to specify an initial
goal for a saved-state to call when run.

   <p>The difference between <code>save_program/1</code> and <code>save/[1,2]</code> in
previous releases of Quintus Prolog was that <code>save_program/1</code> saved
only the Prolog database, whereas <code>save/[1,2]</code> saved both the
Prolog database and the Prolog execution stacks.  It has not been
possible to retain the saving of the Prolog execution stacks in a way
consistent with the release 3 support of embeddability
and the general portability of QOF files.  This is why <code>save/[1,2]</code>
have been removed.  The reasoning goes as follows:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>QOF files are a completely portable machine-independent representation
of Prolog data. 
<li>It is difficult, if not impossible, to make the Prolog execution state
portable in the same way as facts and rules in QOF files (see further
points). 
<li>QOF files can also be combined and loaded in flexible ways, and it is
unclear what this would mean for execution states. 
<li>The QOF file saved-states do <em>not</em> save any C (or other foreign language)
state. This is a change from the previous Quintus Prolog saved-states,
and is further discussed below. 
<li>In the general case, Prolog execution can now be arbitrarily interleaved
with C (or other) function calls since Prolog and C are completely
intercallable and can call each other recursively. 
<li>Since the C state is not saved, it is not possible to meaningfully save
the Prolog execution state in the general case where it depends on
interleaved C execution state. 
<li>In addition, Prolog code embedded in a C (or other) application is
highly likely to be manipulating C data, such as pointers and other
process-specific information. This data would be meaningless if restored
into another process, and indeed would be likely to cause faults.
        </ol>

   <p>The model that an arbitrary Prolog execution state can be saved thus
only works well within a Prolog-only situation.  In the complex
embedded environments supported by Quintus Prolog release 3
this model cannot work properly.  Hence the removal of the facility.

   <p>As mentioned in points 4-7 above, an additional important aspect here
is that Prolog no longer makes any attempt to save the state of C (or
other foreign language) code.  This was a feature of saved-states in
previous releases where both the C code and its data structures were
saved (as a memory image) into saved-states.  This was a feature that
caused many problems.  A primary problem was that the saved C state
was initialized (variables retained their values when restored) and
yet the initialized C state could contain many items that were no
longer valid in the new process, such as addresses and file
descriptors.  Such code would often fail when restored.  In addition,
Prolog was unable to guarantee that it had saved all the necessary
foreign code state.  With the advent of shared libraries and other
complex memory management facilities in the operating system, it
became impossible for Prolog to control and manage the states of other
tools in the address space.

   <p>When one takes a step back and looks at Prolog in the light of the
goals of release 3 (see <a href="int-hig.html#int-hig">int-hig</a>) -- where Prolog code is
a component that can be embedded in complex applications written in
many languages -- it is clearly unreasonable for Prolog to try and
control, let alone save, arbitrary non-Prolog state.  The Prolog
operations for saving and loading QOF files now operate solely on the
Prolog database and these operations do not involve making any
assumptions about non-Prolog state. This is a much cleaner and more
robust approach, and is the most appropriate when Prolog applications
become embedded software components.
