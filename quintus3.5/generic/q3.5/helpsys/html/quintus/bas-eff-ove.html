<h4 class="subsection">Overview</h4>

   <p>This section gives a number of tips on how to organize your programs
for increased efficiency.  A lot of clarity and efficiency is gained
by sticking to a few basic rules.  This list is necessarily very
incomplete.  The reader is referred to textbooks such as <cite>The
Craft of Prolog</cite> by Richard O'Keefe, MIT Press, 1990, a thorough
exposition of the elements of Prolog programming style and techniques.

     <ul>

     <li>Don't write code in the first place if there is a library
predicate that will do the job. 
<li>Write clauses representing base case before clauses
representing recursive cases. 
<li>Input arguments before output arguments in clause
heads and goals. 
<li>Use pure data structures instead of database changes. 
<li>Use cuts sparingly, and <em>only</em> at proper places. 
A cut should be placed at the exact point that it
is known that the current choice is the correct one: no sooner, no
later. 
<li>Make cuts as local in their effect as possible.  If a
predicate is intended to be determinate, define <em>it</em> as
such; do not rely on its callers to prevent unintended
backtracking. 
<li>Binding output arguments before a cut is a common
source of programming errors, so don't do it. 
<li>Replace cuts by if-then-else constructs if the test is simple enough. 
<li>Use disjunctions sparingly, <em>always</em> put parentheses around
them, <em>never</em> put parentheses around the individual disjuncts, and
<em>never</em> put the <code>;</code> at the end of a line. 
<li>Write the clauses of a predicate so that they discriminate
on the principal functor of the first argument (see below). 
For maximum efficiency, avoid "defaulty" programming ("catch-all"
clauses). 
<li>Don't use lists (<code>[...]</code>), "round lists" (<code>(...)</code>),
or braces (<code>{...</code>}) to represent compound terms, or
"tuples", of some fixed arity.  The name of a compound
term comes for free.
