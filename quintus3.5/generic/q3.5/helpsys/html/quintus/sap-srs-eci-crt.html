<h5 class="subsubsection">Compile-time code vs. Runtime code</h5>

   <p>A Prolog program has up to three types of code in it:
     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>code that implements the application;
<li>code that helps compile the application, and that is not used during the
execution of the application;
<li>code that is necessary to both the execution of the application and its
compilation.
        </ol>
 The first type of code is the normal case and may be
referred to as <dfn>runtime code</dfn>, since it is intended to be executed
when the application is run.  The second type of code is called
<dfn>compile-time code</dfn>.  Any predicates that are to be called from
embedded commands are examples of compile-time code.  The other main
use of compile-time code is in the definition of <code>term_expansion/2</code>,
which allows you to specify arbitrary transformations to be done by
the compiler as it reads in clauses.  See the reference page for more
information on <code>term_expansion/2</code>.

   <p>When using the built-in compiler in the Development System, no
distinction has to be made between the three types of code.  They can
coexist in one file.  Before using <code>qpc</code> on a program,
however, compile-time code must be separated out into its own file (or
files).  Then, to each file that needs this new file or files at
compile time, add the goal (A) near the top of the file.  This tells
<code>qpc</code> to load <var>NewFile</var> directly into <code>qpc</code>
before further compiling the current file.  It does <em>not</em> include
<var>NewFile</var> as a runtime dependency of the file.  If you need
<var>NewFile</var> to be loaded at compile time and also at runtime, use
the goal (B) instead.  This approach will work in the Development
System as well as <code>qpc</code>.
<pre class="example">     :- load_files(NewFile, [when(compile_time)]).   (A)
     :- load_files(NewFile, [when(both)]).           (B)
     </pre>

   <p>Alternatively, you may omit the use of <code>load_files/2</code>, instead
specifying files to be loaded into <code>qpc</code> with the
<code>-i</code> option.  In this case, when you want to compile this
file into the Development System, remember to first load the file(s) needed at
compile time.

   <p>It is good programming style to use <code>initialization/1</code> for goals to
be activated at runtime.  Note that predicates called as <code>:- Goal.</code>
need to be available at compile time, whereas predicates called as
<code>:- initialization(Goal).</code> only need to be available at runtime.
