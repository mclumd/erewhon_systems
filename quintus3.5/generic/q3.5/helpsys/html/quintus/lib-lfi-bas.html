<h4 class="subsection">Introduction -- <code>library(directory)</code></h4>

   <p>For the most part, Prolog programs have little need to examine
directories or to inquire about file properties.  However, the
need does occasionally arise.  For example, an expert-system
shell might offer the option of either loading a single file
into its knowledge base, or of loading all the files in a
directory having a particular extension.  The Quintus Prolog
library file <code>library(directory)</code> provides the tools you need
to do this.  For example, we might define
<pre class="example">     kb_load(File) :-
         (  directory_property(File, searchable) -&gt;
               forall(file_member_of_directory(File,'*.kb',_,Full),
                        kb_load(Full))
         ;  file_property(File, readable) -&gt;
               kb_load_file(File)
         ;  format(user_error, '~N! cannot read ~w.~n', [File]),
            fail
         ).
     </pre>

   <p>The routines in this package were designed to be a complete toolkit
for safely wandering around a UNIX-like file system.  Although there
are quite a few of them, they do actually fit together in a coherent
group.  For information on operations relating to individual files rather
than to directories, see <code>library(files)</code> (<a href="lib-ofi.html#lib-ofi">lib-ofi</a>).

   <p>The following principles have been observed:

     <ul>

     <li>An absolute distinction is drawn between files and directories. 
The set of operations
one can usefully perform on a directory is different from the set
one can perform on a file:  for example, having
write permission to a directory allows the user to create new files in
it, not to rewrite the entire directory!  If any routine in this package
tells you that a "file" exists, you can be sure that it means a
"regular" file. 
<li>The directory scanning routines do not actually open the files they
find.  Thus finer discriminations, such as that between
source and object code, are not made. 
<li>The predicate names
are made up of complete English words in lowercase, separated
by underscores, with no abbreviations. 
<li>Every predicate acts like a genuine logical relation insofar as it
possibly can. 
<li>Like those in the <code>library(unix)</code> package, if anything goes wrong, the
predicates in <code>library(directory)</code>
raise an error exception.  Any time that a predicate
fails quietly, it should mean "this question is meaningful, but the
answer is no"; any exception to this should be regarded as a bug. 
<li>The directory scanning routines insist that the directory argument
name a searchable directory.  But the "property" routines
are to be read as "there exists a thing of such a type with such
a property", and quietly fail if there is no such file or
directory.
