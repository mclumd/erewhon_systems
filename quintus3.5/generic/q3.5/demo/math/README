The math library is an interface to the standard math C library of
floating point (mostly transcendental) functions.


This directory contains 2 files necessary for running the C math library
demo:

math.c		C math library interface
math.pl		Prolog math library interface


To use the math library, first compile the C source file, math.c, to
produce the object file math.o:

	% cc -c math.c

or do 'make' in this directory

Now load the Prolog interface file

        | ?- [demo(math)].		% or compile(demo(math)).

This will load the math binary ('math.o') as well as defining the interface
from Prolog to the C functions in the library.

For help on running the demo, call help/0.
