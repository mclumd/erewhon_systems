/*  @(#)README	28.1 02/11/91 */

This README file is a simple description about how to run the 
programs in this directory.  Read BENCH.DOC for a better
description.

nrev.pl provides the traditional naive reverse benchmark which
has been somewhat discredited by the efforts of various Prolog
implementors to optimize it.  To run it:

	| ?- [demo(nrev)]. 	% or compile(demo(nrev)).
	...
	| ?- lots.



benches.pl provides a suite of benchmarks by Fernando Pereira.
Each of these attempts to measure one aspect of a Prolog system.
To run it:

	| ?- [demo(benches)].	% or compile(demo(benches)).
	...
	| ?- test_benches.



knight.pl is a Prolog version of a benchmark which has been used on LISP
systems.
To run it:
	| ?- [demo(knight)].	% or compile(demo(knight)).
	| ?- tour.		% This will take a lot of computing time
