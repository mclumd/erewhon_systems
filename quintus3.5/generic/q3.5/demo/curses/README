The "curses" package is a library package supplied with Berkeley Unix (BSD)
and System V (U5) that allows convenient control of the terminal screen. This 
example of the C interface attaches the curses package to Quintus Prolog so
that each of the entry points to the package is available as a Prolog 
predicate.

The curses packages supplied with Berkeley Unix and System V are not 
compatible with each other.  This directory contains the files necessary
to run the curses demo under Quintus Prolog.  The files that are used
with the Berkeley Unix version of the curses demo have the 'BSD' tag
and the System V files have the 'U5' tag.

BSDcurses.c	Many of the entry points into this package consist of macros
U5curses.c 	rather than C functions.  Since the C-Interface can only work
		for C functions, these files defines dummy functions whose
		only purpose is to call the #defined macro.
	  
BSDcurses.pl	These files contain the declarations for the curses functions
U5curses.pl 	available to the C-Interface.  The file ends with a call to
		load_foreign_files that will actually load the C code.

BSDdemo.pl	These files contain some Prolog procedures built on top of 
U5demo.pl 	the curses package along with comments showing how to call
		the example demos.


To run the curses demo on  Berkeley Unix (BSD)
----------------------------------------------

	first compile BSDcurses.c (to produce BSDcurses.o):

		% cc -c BSDcurses.c

	or do 'make' in this directory.

	Then, start prolog and load the curses package:

		| ?- [demo('BSDcurses')].   % or compile(demo('BSDcurses')).

	At this point, the curses package is loaded.  To run the canned demos,
	load the demo file and call one of the demos.

		| ?- [demo('BSDdemo')].	    % or compile(demo('BSDdemo')).
		| ?- go.



To run the curses demo on  System V (U5) 
----------------------------------------------
 
        first compile U5curses.c (to produce U5curses.o):
 
                % cc -c U5curses.c

	or do 'make' in this directory
                                               
        Then, start prolog and load the curses package:
 
                | ?- [demo('U5curses')].   % or compile(demo('U5curses')).
 
        At this point, the curses package is loaded.  To run the canned demos,
        load the demo file and call one of the demos.
 
                | ?- [demo('U5demo')]. 	   % or compile(demo('U5demo')).
                | ?- go.
