The files in this directory are by Richard A. O'Keefe, and they demonstrate
alternative search strategies in the context of a simple eight-puzzle.
The best place to start is by looking at the file called eight_puzzle which
explains the problem.  Then load one of the search files.  For example,

	| ?- [demo(depth_first)].	% or compile(demo(depth_first)).
	| ?- depth_first_search(Position,Moves).

These examples can be used as an example to program different search
strategies in Prolog (dispell the myth that Prolog is good only for
depth first search, whatever that means). They can also be used
to see the effect of different search strategies for the eight-puzzle.

The initial configuration and the desired final configurations
can be changed by chaging the facts starting_position/1 and
solution/1 in the file eight_puzzle. The board is represented
by a '/'/2 term whose first argument is the location of the
blank and whose second argument is a b/9 term which lists the
tiles. The blank tile is represented with an x.
