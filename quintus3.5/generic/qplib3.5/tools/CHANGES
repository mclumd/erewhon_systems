Changes in tools/ part of the Quintus Prolog Library, July 1998
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Enhancements to the xref program, by Tom Howland:

	1. The new '-c' generates standard compiler style error messages.
	2. Bug fixes.


Changes in tools/ part of the Quintus Prolog Library, August 1994
--------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a completely new version of xref, written by Tom Howland
of Knowledgeware. The advantages of the new xref program are:

	1. 40 times faster
	2. does not follow unreachable code. Consequently you get a
	   listing of *all* unreachable predicates
	3. tells you which *files* are unreachable (when none of the
	   predicates in a file are reachable)
	4. understands initializations and externs
	5. can be compiled into a stand alone program
	6. is not confused by relative pathnames in load commands
	7. does not complain if term expansion returns an empty list
	8. uses term expansion

There is one disadvantage: it will not cross reference built-in
predicates.


Changes in tools/ part of the Quintus Prolog Library, September 1990
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The tools can now be installed for multiple platforms.  There is a
"make install" option for installing all the tools into a standard
"bin" area on your system (default: /usr/local/bin).  See the
makefile for more information.

The executable/saved-state files are now mostly named with a "qp"
prefix so that they will be grouped alphabetically with the other
Quintus Prolog tools (qpc, qld etc) when installed in a bin area.

Some bugs have been fixed in qpchecker and qpxref.

qplint has not yet been fully upgraded to know about all the QP*
functions that are defined in release 3.0.  It has been upgraded to
use C-calling-Prolog instead of running separate C and Prolog processes.
On SunOS 4.1, it is recommended to use the "-u" lint option, as in

	% qplint -u <Prolog and C files>

to avoid getting a lot of irrelevant "used but not defined" messages which
don't show up on earlier SunOS versions.

Some of the tools are being built as saved-states, and some as 
stand-alone programs.  Saved-states are smaller and get loaded
on startup.  All the tools can be built either way, depending
on preference: see the makefile.

The tools are now considered to be supported.  Please notify
qpsupport@sics.se if you find any problems.

Changes in tools/ part of the Quintus Prolog Library, August 1989
-----------------------------------------------------------------

New tools:

	det		assists in finding places where cuts should
			be added (for correctness and efficiency)

	arity2quintus	assists in translating programs written for
			Arity Prolog to run under Quintus Prolog

	optool		a tool for finding which files rely on op 
			declarations - this is useful when modifying a 
			program to run under the Runtime Generator



Changes in tools/ part of the Quintus Prolog Library, November 1988
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Most files have had minor edits to improve the file headers and make the
version numbering consistent so that the Unix command 'what' will always
find an SCCS identification string in each file.  All files have also been
tested on both Unix 4.2bsd and Unix System V.  All occurances of comments
after "#else" and "#endif" in C source files have been enclosed in comment
delimiters to avoid warnings from some System V C compilers. Appropriate
C casts have also been added where necessary to avoid unnecessary warnings
on different Unix systems. The comments below do not mention any of these
simple changes - only changes of some semantic significance are noted.


Changed Tools Files:

	plint.c			Has been fixed so that it works properly
				with Quintus' current implementation of saved
				states and also so that it works on System V.

	xref.doc		New functionality added for handling clauses
	xrfdef.pl		that get expandded by term_expansion/2 into
				something different - as happens in Quintus'
				database interface.

	xrf.pl			General cleaning up and some significant
				rewriting. P->Q conditionals now handled
				properly.

	xrfmod.pl		General cleaning up.

	xrfout.pl		General cleaning up and commenting out of
				obsolete code.
