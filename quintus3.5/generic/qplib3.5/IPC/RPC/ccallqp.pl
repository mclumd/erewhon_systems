/*  These Prolog routines allow a C program to call a Prolog servant.
    These routines are used by the servant to communicate with the C
    program.  C programs can call certain Prolog predicates defined in
    the servant's database.  These predicates must be declared as
    callable by C by means of external/3 facts.  The predicates and
    external facts must be in the user: module.

    Declarations of Prolog routines that can be called by C are as follows:

	external(Routine_Name_For_C, xdr,
		 Prolog_Predicate_Name(parspec1,parspec2,..)).

    The parameter specifications of 'external' predicates are
    similar to those of 'foreign' predicates:
	+integer, -integer,
	+string,  -string,
	+float,   -float,
	+atom,    -atom.
    (The indication that a parameter is a function return is not
    appropriate for Prolog's side of the interface.)  For example,
    +integer means that an integer will be supplied by the C program
    when this predicate is called; -string means that the Prolog
    predicate will generate a string value and return it to the calling
    C program.

    For example, suppose you want compile/1 to be available to the
    C master program under the name 'plc'.  Then you would write
	external(plc, xdr, compile(+string)).
    Or to enable the master to inspect its servant's library
    directory table under the name 'lib', you would write
	external(lib, xdr, library_directory(-string)).
    There is normally no reason for the Routine_Name_For_C and
    Prolog_Predicate_Name to be different.

/*  The xdrsock routines allow Prolog to set up and communicate

    Note that we don't need a library() wrapper around xdrsock,

    it would be wrong to put it there.
    The sockutil routines are for tracing and error reporting.

    There are two cases:
	REMOTE EXECUTION THROUGH SOCKETS
	    This command was started up as
		rsh ${HostName} -n ${SavedState} \
		    -socket ${CallHost} ${CallPort} '&' &

		    >${OutputFile} 2>&1 '&' &

		${SavedState} -socket ${CallHost} ${CallPort}
	    and we have to call back to ${CallPort} AT ${CallHost}.

	LOCAL EXECUTION THROUGH PIPES
	    This command was started up directly through fork() & exec(),
	    but could be described roughly as
		${SavedState} </dev/null ${I}<${PipeIn} ${O}>${PipeOut} \
		    -pipe ${I} ${O} &

		${SavedState} </dev/null ${I}<${PipeIn} ${O}>${PipeOut} \
