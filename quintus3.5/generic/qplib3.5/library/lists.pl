/*  Several of the comments below indicate that a particular predicate
    only works when a particular argument "is a proper list".  In
    general, an instance of a recursively defined data type "foo" is
    said to be "a proper foo" when it is a non-variable and all its
    "foo" components are proper foos.  For example, consider
	:- type tree(K,V) = {} | node(K,V,tree(K,V),tree(K,V)).
    X is said to be "a proper tree" if X is {} or if X is node(_,_,L,R)
    where both L and R are proper trees.  Similarly, X is a proper list
    if and only if X is [] or X is [_|L] where L is a proper list.
    The point is that a recursive procedure working its way down a
    proper whatever will not be creating new structure.  The predicate
    is_list/1 recognises proper lists.

    In general, the predicates in this file are only defined when the
    arguments have types compatible with the :- pred declaration below
    instantiated compatibly with the :- mode declaration below.  Their
    effect on other inputs is not defined.  For example,
	append([], 1, X, 2, Y)
    succeeds, binding X = 1 and Y = 2.  This is rather odd, but since
    the query is ill-typed the behaviour is not an error.

%   append(+ListOfLists, ?List)
%   is true when ListOfLists is a list [L1,...,Ln] of lists, List is
%   a list, and appending L1, ..., Ln together yields List.  The
%   ListOfLists **must** be a proper list.  (Strictly speaking we
%   should produce an error message if it is not, but this version
%   fails.)  Additionally, either List should be a proper list, or
%   each of L1, ..., Ln should be a proper list.  The behaviour on
%   non-lists is undefined.  ListOfLists must be proper because for
%   any given solution, infinitely many more can be obtained by
%   inserting nils ([]) into ListOfList.

append(-, _) :- !, fail.	% reject partial lists.
append([], []).
append([L|Ls], List0) :-
	append(L, List1, List0),

%   append(?Prefix, ?Tail1, ?List1, ?Tail2, ?List2)
%   is true when append(Prefix, Tail1, List1) and append(Prefix, Tail2, List2)
%   are both true.  You could call append/3 twice, but that is order-
%   dependent.  This will terminate if Prefix is a proper list or if
%   either List1 or List2 is a proper list.

append([], List1, List1, List2, List2).
append([H|T], Tail1, [H|List1], Tail2, [H|List2]) :-
	append(T, Tail1, List1, Tail2, List2).



%   correspond(X, Xlist, Ylist, Y)
%   is true when Xlist and Ylist are lists, X is an element of Xlist, Y is
%   an element of Ylist, and X and Y are in similar places in their lists.
%   No relation is implied between other elements of Xlist and Ylist.
%   For a similar predicate without the cut, see select/4 below.


correspond(X, [X|_], [Y|_], Y) :- !.
correspond(X, [_|T], [_|U], Y) :-
	correspond(X, T, U, Y).



%   delete(+List, +Kill, ?Residue)
%   is true when List is a list, in which Kill may or may not occur, and
%   Residue is a copy of List with all elements equal to Kill deleted.
%   To extract a single copy of Kill, use select(Kill, List, Residue).
%   If List is not proper, delete/3 will FAIL.  Kill and the elements of
%   List should be sufficiently instantiated for \= to be sound.

delete([Head|Tail], Kill, [Head|Residue]) :-
    %	Head \= Kill,

%   delete(+List, +Kill, +Count, ?Residue)
%   is true when List is a list, in which Kill may or may not occur,
%   and Count is a non-negative integer, and Residue is a copy of
%   List with the first Count elements equal to Kill deleted.  If
%   List has fewer than Count elements equal to Count, all of them
%   are deleted.
%   If List is not proper, delete/4 may FAIL.  Kill and the elements of
%   List should be sufficiently instantiated for \= to be sound.

delete(List, Kill, N, Residue) :-

delete_1([Head|Tail], Kill, N, [Head|Residue]) :-
    %	Head \= Kill,

%   is_list(+List)
%   succeeds when List is a proper list.  That is, List is nil ([]) or
%   a cons cell ([Head|Tail]) whose Tail is a proper list.
%   A variable, or a list whose final tail is a variable, will fail this
%   test.

is_list([_|Tail]) :-
	is_list(Tail).



%   keys_and_values(?[K1-V1,...,Kn-Vn], ?[K1,...,Kn], ?[V1,...,Vn])
%   is true when its arguments look like the picture above.  It is meant
%   for splitting a list of Key-Value pairs (such as keysort/2 wants and
%   produces) into separate lists of Keys and of Values.  It may just as
%   well be used for building a list of pairs from a pair of lists.   In
%   fact one usually wants just the keys or just the values, but you can
%   supply _ as the other argument.   For example, suppose you wanted to
%   sort a list without having duplicates removed.  You could do
%	keys_and_values(RawPairs, RawKeys, _),
%	keysort(RawPairs, OrdPairs),
%	keys_and_values(OrdPairs, OrdKeys, _).
%   (In fact this operation is msort/2 and should be available somewhere.)

keys_and_values([], [], []).
keys_and_values([Key-Value|Pairs], [Key|Keys], [Value|Values]) :-
	keys_and_values(Pairs, Keys, Values).



%   last(?Last, +List)
%   is true when List is a List and Last is its last element.
%   The argument order is surprising; if it followed the recommended
%   inputs-before-outputs rule, it would be last(List -> Last).
%   There is also a last(?Fore, ?Last, ?List) in library(listparts),
%   whose argument order matches append/3, and this is consistent with
%   that, but last/3 came after.  "Backwards compatibility" is the excuse.
%   This could be defined as last(X,L) :- append(_, [X], L).

last(Last, [Head|Tail]) :-
	last_1(Tail, Head, Last).		

last_1([], Last, Last).
last_1([Head|Tail], _, Last) :-
	last_1(Tail, Head, Last).



%   nextto(?X, ?Y, +List)
%   is true when X and Y appear side-by-side in List.
%   It could be written as
%	nextto(X, Y, List) :- append(_, [X,Y|_], List).
%   It may be used to enumerate successive pairs from the list.
%   List should be proper, otherwise nextto/3 will generate it.

nextto(X,Y, [X,Y|_]).
nextto(X,Y, [_|List]) :-
	nextto(X,Y, List).



%   nmember(Elem, List, Index)
%   is true when Elem is the Indexth member of List.  Could be written as
%	nmember(X, L, N) :- append(B, [X|_], L), length(B, M), N is M+1.
%   It may be used to select a particular element, or to find where some
%   given element occurs, or to enumerate the elements and indices together.
%   It is now an alias for nth1/3, which should be used in new programs.

nmember(Element, List, Index) :-
	nth1(Index, List, Element).



%   nth0(?N, ?List, ?Elem)
%   is true when Elem is the Nth member of List, counting the first as
%   element 0.  That is, throw away the first N elements and unify Elem
%   with the next.  E.g. nth0(0, [H|T], H).
%   Either N should be an integer, or List should be proper.

nth0(Index, List, Element) :-
	(   integer(Index) ->		% are we finding Element?
	    Index >= 0,
	    nth0i(Index, List, Element)
	;   var(Index) ->		% or are we finding Index?
	    nth0v(List, Element, 0, Index)
	;   should_be(integer, Index, 1, nth0(Index,List,Element))
	).


%   nth0v: find the Index of an Element in the given List.
%   The Element might occur more than once, find each place.

nth0v([Element|_], Element, Index, Index).
nth0v([_|Tail], Element, M, Index) :-
	N is M+1,
	nth0v(Tail, Element, N, Index).


%   nth0i: find an Element in the given List at a known Index >= 0.

nth0i(N, [Head|Tail], Elem) :-
	(   N =:= 0 -> Elem = Head
	;   M is N-1,			% should be succ(M, N)
	    nth0i(M, Tail, Elem)
	).


%   nth1(?N, ?List, ?Element)
%   is true when Elem is the Nth member of List, counting the first as
%   element 1.  That is, throw away the first N-1 elements and unify Elem
%   with the next element (the Nth).  E.g. nth1(1, [H|T], H).
%   This is just like nth0 except that it counts from 1 instead of 0.
%   Either N should be an integer, or List should be proper.

nth1(Index, List, Element) :-
	(   integer(Index) ->		% are we finding Element?
	    Index >= 1,
	    N is Index-1,
	    nth0i(N, List, Element)
	;   var(Index) ->		% or are we finding Index?
	    nth0v(List, Element, 1, Index)
	;   should_be(integer, Index, 1, nth1(Index,List,Element))
	).



%   nth0(?N, ?List, ?Elem, ?Rest)
%   unifies Elem with the Nth element of List, counting from 0, and Rest
%   with the other elements.  It can be used to select the Nth element
%   of List (yielding Elem and Rest), or to insert Elem *before* the Nth
%   (counting from 0) element of Rest, when it yields List, e.g.
%   nth0(2, List, c, [a,b,d,e]) unifies List with [a,b,c,d,e].
%   This can be seen as inserting Elem *after* the Nth element of Rest
%   if you count from 1 rather than 0.
%   Either N should be an integer, or List or Rest should be proper.

nth0(Index, List, Elem, Rest) :-
	(   integer(Index) ->		% are we finding Elem?
	    Index >= 0,
	    nth0i(Index, List, Elem, Rest)
	;   var(Index) ->		% or are we finding Index?
	    one_longer(List, Rest),
	    nth0v(List, Elem, 0, Index, Rest)
	;   should_be(integer, Index, 1, nth0(Index,List,Elem,Rest))
	).


nth0i(N, [Head|Tail], Elem, Rest) :-
	(   N =:= 0 ->
	    Elem = Head, Rest = Tail
	;   M is N-1,			% succ(M, N); should fail if N < 1
	    Rest = [Head|More],
	    nth0i(M, Tail, Elem, More)
	).


nth0v([Head|Tail], Head, Index, Index, Tail).
nth0v([Head|Tail], Elem, M, Index, [Head|Rest]) :-
	N is M+1,
	nth0v(Tail, Elem, N, Index, Rest).


%   nth1(?N, ?List, ?Elem, ?Rest)
%   unifies Elem with the Nth element of List, counting from 1, and Rest
%   with the other elements.  It can be used to select the Nth element
%   of List (yielding Elem and Rest), or to insert Elem *before* the Nth
%   (counting from 1) element of Rest, when it yields List, e.g.
%   nth1(2, List, b, [a,c,d,e]) unifies List with [a,b,c,d,e].
%   Either N should be an integer, or List or Rest should be proper.

nth1(Index, List, Elem, Rest) :-
	(   integer(Index) ->		% are we finding Elem?
	    Index >= 1,
	    N is Index-1,
	    nth0i(N, List, Elem, Rest)
	;   var(Index) ->		% or are we finding Index?
	    one_longer(List, Rest),
	    nth0v(List, Elem, 1, Index, Rest)
	;   should_be(integer, Index, 1, nth1(Index,List,Elem,Rest))
	).



%   one_longer(Longer, Shorter)
%   is true when length(Longer,N) & length(Shorter,M) & succ(M,N)
%   for some integers M, N.  It was
%   written to make {nth0,nth1}/4 able to find the index, just as
%   same_length/2 is useful for making things invertible.

one_longer([_|RestLonger], Shorter) :-
	same_length(RestLonger, Shorter).



%   perm(+List, ?Perm)
%   is true when List and Perm are permutations of each other.  The main
%   use of perm/2 is to generate permutations.  You should not use this
%   predicate in new programs; use permutation/2 instead.  List must be
%   a proper list.  Perm may be partly instantiated.

perm([], []).
perm([X|Xs], Ys1) :-
	perm(Xs, Ys),
	insert(Ys, X, Ys1).


insert(L, X, [X|L]).
insert([H|T], X, [H|L]) :-
	insert(T, X, L).



%   permutation(?List, ?Perm)
%   is true when List and Perm are permuations of each other.
%   Unlike perm/2, it will work even when List is not a proper list.
%   It even acts in a marginally sensible way when Perm isn't proper
%   either, but it will still backtrack forever.
%   Be careful: this is quite efficient, but the number of permutations of an
%   N-element list is N!, and even for a 7-element list that is 5040.

permutation(List, Perm) :-
	permutation(List, Perm, Perm).

permutation([], [], []).
permutation([X|Xs], Ys1, [_|Zs]) :-
	permutation(Xs, Ys, Zs),
	insert(Ys, X, Ys1).



%   perm2(A,B, C,D)
%   is true when {A,B} = {C,D}.  It is very useful for writing pattern
%   matchers over commutative operators.  It is used more than perm is.

perm2(X,Y, X,Y).
perm2(X,Y, Y,X).



%   proper_length(+List, ?Length)
%   succeeds when List is a proper list, binding Length to its length.
%   That is, is_list(List) & length(List, Length).

proper_length(List, Length) :-
	proper_length(List, 0, Length).

    degrees do pay off for long lists, they don't do a lot for short

proper_length([],          N,  N).



%   remove_dups(+List, ?Pruned)
%   removes duplicated elements from List, which should be a proper list.
%   If List has non-ground elements, Pruned may contain elements which
%   unify; two elements will remain separate iff there is a substitution
%   which makes them different.  E.g. [X,X] -> [X] but [X,Y] -> [X,Y].

remove_dups(List, Pruned) :-
	sort(List, Pruned).



%   reverse(?List, ?Reversed)
%   is true when List and Reversed are lists with the same elements
%   but in opposite orders.  Either List or Reversed should be a
%   proper list: given either argument the other can be found.  If
%   both are incomplete reverse/2 can backtrack forever trying ever
%   longer lists.

reverse(List, Reversed) :-
	reverse(List, Reversed, [], Reversed).

reverse([], [], Reversed, Reversed).
reverse([Head|Tail], [_|Bound], Sofar, Reversed) :-

%   rev(+List, ?Reversed)
%   is a version of reverse/2 which only works one way around.
%   Its List argument must be a proper list whatever Reversed is.
%   You should use reverse/2 in new programs, though rev/2 is
%   faster when it is safe to use it.

rev(List, Reversed) :-
	rev(List, [], Reversed).

rev([], Reversed, Reversed).
rev([Head|Tail], Sofar, Reversed) :-
	rev(Tail, [Head|Sofar], Reversed).



%   same_length(?List1, ?List2)
%   is true when List1 and List2 are both lists and have the same number
%   of elements.  No relation between the values of their elements is
%   implied.  It may be used to generate either list given the other,
%   or indeed to generate two lists of the same length, in which case
%   the arguments will be bound to lists of length 0, 1, 2, ... 
%   The current versions of reverse/2 and permutation/2 were obtained
%   by mixing this in with unidirectional versions.

same_length([], []).
same_length([_|List1], [_|List2]) :-
	same_length(List1, List2).



%   same_length(?List1, ?List2, ?Length)
%   is true when List1 and List2 are both lists, Length is a non-negative
%   integer, and both List1 and List2 have exactly Length elements.  No
%   relation between the elements of the lists is implied.  If Length
%   is instantiated, or if either List1 or List2 is bound to a proper
%   list, same_length is determinate and terminating.  library(length)
%   has more predicates with this structure.

same_length(List1, List2, Length) :-

%   select(?X, ?Xlist, ?Y, ?Ylist)
%   is true when X is the Kth member of Xlist and Y the Kth element of Ylist
%   for some K, and apart from that Xlist and Ylist are the same.  You can
%   use it to replace X by Y or vice versa.  Either Xlist or Ylist should
%   be a proper list.  This is very like sets:select/3.  Note that the
%   arguments are like the arguments of member/2, twice.

%   selectchk(?X, +Xlist, ?Y, +Ylist)
%   is to select/4 as memberhck/2 is to member/2.  That is, it finds the
%   first K such that X unifies with the Kth element of Xlist and Y with
%   the Kth element of Ylist, and it commits to the bindings thus found.
%   If you have Keys and Values in "parallel" lists, you can use this to
%   find the Value associated with a particular Key (much better methods
%   exist).  Except for argument order, this is identical to correspond/4,
%   but selectchk/4 is a member of a coherent family.  Note that the
%   arguments are like the arguments of memberchk/2, twice.

%   shorter_list(Short, Long)
%   is true when Short is a list is strictly shorter than Long.  Long
%   doesn't have to be a proper list provided it is long enough.  This
%   can be used to generate lists shorter than Long, lengths 0, 1, 2...
%   will be tried, but backtracking will terminate with a list that is
%   one element shorter than Long.  It cannot be used to generate lists
%   longer than Short, because it doesn't look at all the elements of the
%   longer list.

%   subseq(Sequence, SubSequence, Complement)
%   is true when SubSequence and Complement are both subsequences of the
%   list Sequence (the order of corresponding elements being preserved)
%   and every element of Sequence which is not in SubSequence is in the
%   Complement and vice versa.  That is,
%   length(Sequence) = length(SubSequence)+length(Complement), e.g.
%   subseq([1,2,3,4], [1,3,4], [2]).  This was written to generate subsets
%   and their complements together, but can also be used to interleave two
%   lists in all possible ways.  Note that if S1 is a subset of S2, it will
%   be generated *before S2 as a SubSequence and *after it as a Complement.

%   subseq0(+Sequence, ?SubSequence)
%   is true when SubSequence is a subsequence of Sequence, but may
%   be Sequence itself.   Thus subseq0([a,b], [a,b]) is true as well

%   sumlist(+Numbers, ?Total)
%   is true when Numbers is a list of integers, and Total is their sum.
%   Note that in Dec-10 compiled Prolog this will only work as stated;

%   note here as elsewhere in Prolog arithmetic that machine arithmetic
%   wraps round in Quintus Prolog: (2^28 - 1)+1 = -2^28 .

%   and Y is its transpose, that is, Y = [[X11,...,Xn1],...,[X1m,...,Xnm]]
%   We insist that both lists should have this rectangular form, so that
