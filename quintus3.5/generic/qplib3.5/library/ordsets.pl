%   In this module, sets are represented by ordered lists with no
%   duplicates.  Thus {c,r,a,f,t} would be [a,c,f,r,t].  The ordering
%   is defined by the @< family of term comparison predicates, which
%   is the ordering used by sort/2 and setof/3.

%   The benefit of the ordered representation is that the elementary
%   set operations can be done in time proportional to the sum of the
%   argument sizes rather than their product.  You should use the
%   operations defined here in preference to those in library(sets)
%   unless there is a compelling reason why you can't.  Some of the
%   unordered set routines, such as member/2, length/2 and select/3 can
%   be used unchanged on ordered sets; feel free so to use them.

%   There is no ordset_to_list/2, as an ordered set is a list already.

%   is_ordset(List)
%   is true when List is a list of terms [T1,T2,...,Tn] and the
%   terms are strictly increasing: T1 @< T2 @< ... @< Tn.  The
%   output of sort/2 always satisfies this test.  Anything which
%   satisfies this test can be given to the predicates in this
%   file, regardless of where you got it.

is_ordset(-) :- !, fail.	% catch and reject variables.

is_ordset([Head|Tail], Left) :-
	Head @> Left,
	is_ordset(Tail, Head).



%   list_to_ord_set(+List, ?Set)
%   is true when Set is the ordered representation of the set represented
%   by the unordered representation List.  The only reason for giving it
%   a name at all is that you may not have realised that sort/2 could be
%   used this way.

list_to_ord_set(List, Set) :-
	sort(List, Set).



%   ord_add_element(+Set1, +Element, ?Set2)
%   is the equivalent of add_element for ordered sets.  It should give
%   exactly the same result as merge(Set1, [Element], Set2), but a bit
%   faster, and certainly more clearly.

%   ord_del_element(+Set1, +Element, ?Set2)
%   is the equivalent of del_element for ordered sets.  Because it uses
%   ordering, it typically builds less structure, but is slower than
%   del_element.  I am beginning to wonder whether a predicate
%	set_plus(SmallSet, Element, LargeSet)
%   would be a better way of doing this, the idea being that
%   LargeSet = SmallSet U {Element} and Element is not in SmallSet.
%   There is already a predicate with this effect called select/3.

%   ord_disjoint(+Set1, +Set2)
%   is true when the two ordered sets have no element in common.  If the
%   arguments are not ordered, I have no idea what happens.

ord_disjoint(Set1, Set2) :-
	\+ ord_intersect(Set1, Set2).



%   ord_intersect(+Set1, +Set2)
%   is true when the two ordered sets have at least one element in common.
%   Note that the test is == rather than = .
%   ord_intersect/2 has been unfolded in ord_intersect/5 to avoid
%   constructing anything.

%   ord_intersect(+Set1, +Set2, ?Intersection)
%   is an obsolete synonym for ord_intersection/3.

ord_intersect(Set1, Set2, Intersection) :-
	ord_intersection(Set1, Set2, Intersection).



%   ord_intersection(+Set1, +Set2, ?Intersection)
%   is true when Intersection is the ordered representation of Set1
%   and Set2, provided that Set1 and Set2 are ordered sets.

	ord_intersection_1(Tail2, Head1, Tail1, Intersection).



%   ord_intersection(+ListOfSets, ?Intersection)
%   is true when ListOfSets is a nonempty proper list of ordered sets
%   and Intersection is their intersection.  Earlier versions of this
%   package used a "logarithmic" method for this, similar to the code
%   in ord_union/2.  However, experiments showed that intersection is
%   better done using a "linear" method (in the case of union, we are
%   faced with _growing_ intermediate results, but in intersection we
%   have a case of _shrinking_ intermediate results).  We cannot take
%   an empty ListOfSets because its intersection is the universe!

%   ord_nonmember(+Item, +Set)
%   is true when the given Item is NOT an element of the given Set.
%   Whether this is faster or slower than basics:nonmember/2 depends
%   on the version of Prolog you are using.  It expresses intent.

%   ord_seteq(+Set1, +Set2)
%   is true when the two arguments represent the same set.  Since they
%   are assumed to be ordered representations, they must be identical.

ord_seteq(Set1, Set2) :-
	Set1 == Set2.

%   ord_setproduct(+Set1, +Set2, ?Product)
%   is in fact identical to setproduct(Set1, Set2, Product).
%   If Set1 and Set2 are ordered sets, Product will be an ordered
%   set of x1-x2 pairs.  Note that we cannot solve for Set1 and
%   Set2, because there are infinitely many solutions when
%   Product is empty, and may be a large number in other cases.

%   is true when Difference contains all and only the elements of Set1
%   which are not also in Set2.

%   ord_symdiff(+Set1, +Set2, ?Difference)
%   is true when Difference is the symmetric difference of Set1 and Set2.

ord_symdiff([], Set2, Set2).
ord_symdiff([Head1|Tail1], Set2, Difference) :-
	ord_symdiff(Set2, Head1, Tail1, Difference).

%   ord_disjoint_union(+Set1, +Set2, ?Union)
%   is true when Set1 and Set2 (given to be ordered sets) have no element
%   in common, and Union is their union.  The meaning is the same as
%	ord_disjoint(Set1, Set2),
%	ord_union(Set1, Set2, Union)
%   but it is more efficient.

ord_disjoint_union_1(>, Head1, Tail1, Head2, Tail2, [Head2|Union]) :-
	ord_disjoint_union_1(Tail2, Head1, Tail1, Union).



%   ord_union(+Set1, +Set2, ?Union)
%   is true when Union is the union of Set1 and Set2.  Note that when
%   something occurs in both sets, we want to retain only one copy.
%   The previous version had some cuts, and was 10-20% slower.

ord_union([], Set2, Set2).
ord_union([Head1|Tail1], Set2, Union) :-
	ord_union_1(Set2, Head1, Tail1, Union).

%   ord_union(+OldSet, +NewSet, ?Union, ?ReallyNew)
%   is true when Union is NewSet U OldSet and ReallyNew is NewSet \ OldSet.
%   This is useful when you have an iterative problem, and you're adding
%   some possibly new elements (NewSet) to a set (OldSet), and as well as
%   getting the updated set (Union) you would like to know which if any of
%   the "new" elements didn't already occur in the set (ReallyNew).

%   ord_union(+ListOfSets, ?Union)
%   is true when ListOfSets is given as a proper list of ordered sets
%   and Union is their union.  Letting K be the length of ListOfSets,
%   and N the sum of the sizes of its elements, the cost is of order
%   N.lg(K).  The auxiliary routine
%   ord_union(N, L, U, R)
%   is true when the union of the first N sets in L is U and
%   R is the remaining elements of L.

ord_union(ListOfSets, Union) :-

/*  You will notice that ord_union/2 and ord_intersection/2 have
    the same structure.  This is no accident.  Suppose we want to
    compute <F>([X1,...,Xn]) = <G>(X1) <H> ... <H> <G>(Xn),
    where <G> is any function, and <H> is associative with left
    identity <E> (it does not need to be commutative or to have
    a right identity) we can perform the calculation in at least
    the following ways:

    <F>_lin(List, Answer) :-
	<F>_lin(List, <E>, Answer).

    <F>_lin([], Answer, Answer).
    <F>_lin([X|Xs], SoFar, Answer) :-
	<G>(X, Xg),
	<H>(SoFar, Xg, Next),
	<F>_lin(Xs, Next, Answer).


    <F>_log(List, Answer) :-
	length(List, Length),
	<F>_log(Length, List, Answer, []

    <F>_log(0, R, <E>, R) :- !.
    <F>_log(1, [X|R], Answer, R) :- !,
	<G>(X Answer).
    <F>_log(2, [X1,X2|R], Answer, R) :- !,
	<G>(X1, G1),
	<G>(X2, G2),
	<H>(G1, G2, Answer).
    <F>_log(N, R0, Answer, R) :-
	P is N>>1,	% |first  half of list|
	Q is N- P,	% |second half of list|
	<F>_log(P, R0, A, R1),
	<F>_log(Q, R1, B, R),
	<H>(A, B, Answer).

    You will note that the third clause of <F>_log/4 is actually
    redundant.  If you partially evaluate the fourth clause with
    N=2 that is the answer you get.  The optimisation is usually
    a good idea.  You will further note that the first clause of
    <F>_log/4 is only used when <F>_log([], X) is called, so it
    could be moved up into that procedure.

    The <F>_lin schema is easy to grasp.  However, the <F>_log
    schema can be considerably more efficient.  Consider sorting.
    Here <E> = [], <G>(X,[X]), and <H>(X,Y,Z) = merge(X,Y,Z).
    Merging a single element into a list of length N costs O(N)
    time, so <sort>_lin would take O(N**2) time to sort a list
    of length N, whereas <sort>_log would take O(N.lgN) time.
    Hence the names.  <F>_log is a real win when the cost of the
    <H> operation is non-trivial and increases with bigger
    operands.  Numerical analysts know that <sum>_log is often
    the best way to sum a list of floating point numbers, that is,
    that it gives a more accurate answer (because there are only
    O(lgN) roundoffs in it, as opposed to O(N) in <sum>_lin), but
    that is a rather marginal case.  sumlist/3 in library(lists)
    is <sum>_lin because it was originally intended for integers.
