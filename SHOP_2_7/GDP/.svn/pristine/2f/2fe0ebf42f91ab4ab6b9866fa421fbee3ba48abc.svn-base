;;; SEEK-PLANS is the basic planning engine.  Here are its arguments:
;;;  - STATE is the current state;
;;;  - TASKS is the list of remaining tasks to accomplish;
;;;  - TOP-TASKS is the agenda of tasks to be worked first,
;;;    based on the :immediate keyword
;;;  - PARTIAL-PLAN is the partial plan accumulated so far, with the
;;;    steps listed in reverse order;
;;;  - PARTIAL-PLAN-COST is the total cost of the partial plan
;;;  - DEPTH is the current level of recursive calls to SEEK-PLANS;
;;;  - WHICH-PLANS has the same meaning as the WHICH argument to FIND-PLANS
;;; Rather than returning the plans, SEEK-PLANS puts them into the dynamically
;;; scoped variable *PLANS-FOUND*.  Ordinarily I'd consider this to be poor
;;; coding style, but in this case it makes the coding significantly cleaner.
;;;
;;; Seek-plans has been broken down into the following lower level
;;; functions, below: seek-plans-task, seek-plans-primitive,
;;;                   seek-plans-nonprimitive, seek-plans-null
