;;; Explanation of satisifiers
;;; ------------------------------------------------------------------------

; The following code is invoked only if the :explanation keyword for
;  the planner has been given a true value.

; Given a goal unified by a valid satisfier, construct an assertion
;  that explains how the unifier satisfied that goal and an
;  attribution for the explanation (if it exists).  For example, if
;  the original goal were:
;    '(and (or (and (on ?a ?b) (on ?a ?c)) (on ?d ?a)) (on ?b ?c))
;  and a unifier ((?a.x1) (?b.x2) (?c.x3)) then the explanation would be:
;    '(and (and (on x1 x2) (on x1 x3)) (on x2 x3))
;
; If any term or conjunct in the explanation comes from an external
;  query (see the external-query routine), a list containing the term
;  :source followed by attribution information is added to the
;  beginning of the term or conjunct.  In the above example, if the
;  attribution for (and (on x1 x2) (on x1 x3)) were (PoliceReport
;  UID1234), and the attribution for (on x2 x3) were (PoliceReport
;  UID4321) then the explanation would be
