# The GoDeL Planning System, v0.1

This is the source code for the Goal Decomposition with Landmarks (GoDeL) planning system. The corresponding research paper that talks about the workings of this system titled *The GoDeL Planning System: A More Perfect Union of Domain-Independent and Hierarchical Planning* was published at The International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (**IJCAI 2013**). Please find the paper [here](http://www.cs.umd.edu/~svikas/files/shivashankar2013godel.pdf).

GoDeL is built on top of the [FastDownward Planning System](http://fast-downward.org), a codebase providing a very useful set of libraries specific to AI Planning.
