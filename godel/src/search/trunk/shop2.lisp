;;; REVISION LOG

; ****************** Revisions since SHOP2 1.2 Release

;;;  [2007/04/30:jm] Dividing the main SHOP2 Lisp file to separate the
;;;  theorem prover, and providing the prover as a separate package.

;;;  [2005/05/26:rpg] Substantial changes that can be found in the CVS
;;;  changelog.
;;   [2004/12/30:rpg] An enormous modification for check-in to
;;   sourceforge.  This set of changes contains modifications to
;;   improve the return of plan trees from SHOP2; the introduction of
;;   LIST type DEFSTRUCTS (STATE, OPERATOR, and OPERATOR-NODE) to
;;   provide named accessors to data structures (makes a little easier
;;   to understand for now, could be an intermediate step towards more
;;   efficient implementation using true DEFSTRUCTs later); added
;;   problem-state and problem-tasks "accessor" functions to make
;;   PROBLEM implementation more abstract; added an ASSIGN*
;;   pseudo-logical operator that provides a multiple-binding
;;   equivalent to ASSIGN; modified the SHOP-TRACE mechanism (see
;;   change to SHOP-TRACE argument pattern); added a (rudimentary)
;;   manually-directed planning option; fixed a problem with
;;   retrieving preconditions with already-bound variables; made it
;;   possible to extract a state-trajectory, as well as an operator
;;   sequence and plan tree from FIND-PLANS; also folded in mods from
;;   unreleased UMD 1.3 beta version.

;;   2004.04.05 (rpg) Made functions that encapsulated the choice of
;;   next task to plan for, so that they could be replaced or wrapped
;;   to customize the behavior of SHOP2.  See TASK-SORTER and
;;   CHOOSE-IMMEDIATE-TASK.
;;   Changed the binding of *CURRENT-STATE* to happen earlier, in
;;   SEEK-PLANS, instead of later (in FIND-SATISFIERS).

;;   2004.02.07 (uk) Fixed the variable binding problem in function
;;   MAKE-PROBLEM, that was reported by Robert Goldman as a bug in
;;   DEFPROBLEM macro. The function MAKE-PROBLEM is helpful for backward-
;;   compatability with SHOP -- the earlier version of SHOP2.

;;   2004.02.06 (rpg) Fixed problems in variable-binding interacting
;;   with returning trees.  Added new TREE-STORE object argument to the
;;   SEEK-PLANS-<foo> functions.  Also added code to FIND-PLANS to
;;   recover those trees.  This is only an interim modification: the
;;   original functionaly (although buggy) has not been removed yet.

;;   2003.11.17 (jwm) Provisional modification to the way protections
;;   are handled: protections can now be arbitrary logical expressions
;;   (including references to axioms).  Since this capability creates
;;   the possibility that an addition to a state could violate a
;;   protection, an additional change was required so that protections
;;   are now checked after deletes AND adds (before they were checked
;;   after deletes but before adds).  This has the side-effect that an
;;   operator that deletes and then adds back a protected atom does
;;   not constitute a protection violation (it's not clear that the
;;   former behavior was desirable anyway).

;;   2003.11.04 (rpg) Moved SHOP-TRACE comments into the function as a document
;;   string.

;;   2003.11.03 (rpg) Added an ASSIGN* intended to make it possible to have a
;;   lisp function compute multiple possible bindings for a variable.


; ****************** Revisions since the SHOP2 1.1 Release

;;   2003.9.17 (jwm) Revised the :external keyword (see below); now if
;;   external access fails, an attempt is made to prove the reference
;;   internally.

;;   2003.9.2 (jwm) Modified the call to plan-found-hook (see below)
;;   to send the final plan rather than the internal partial plan.

;;   2003.8.1 (jwm) Added reporting of method preconditions for
;;   shop-trace of methods.

;;   2003.7.17 (jwm) Fixed a minor bug with the shop-trace code
;;   that was causing it to incorrectly report that it was
;;   backtracking from immediate tasks when it actually had
;;   completed planning.

;;   2003.7.9 (jwm) Revised the external-access-hook mechanism (see
;;   the 2003.4.21 revision, below).  There is a new keyword for the
;;   theorem prover: :external.  Any expression that begins with
;;   :external has the following semantics: If there is an
;;   external-access-hook defined, any attempt to prove (:external A B
;;   C ...)  will return the results of running external-access-hook
;;   on the list '(A B C ...).  If there is no external-access-hook
;;   defined, any attempt to prove (:external A B C ...) will return
;;   nil.  In addition, assertions obtained from calling the
;;   external-access-hook are added to the internal state.

;;   2003.6.16 (jwm) There is a new hook routine, trace-query-hook.
;;   If a routine with that name is defined, whenever the shop-trace
;;   module is invoked, that hook routine is invoked on whatever trace
;;   information is available in that point (including the logical atoms
;;   in the current state).
;;   This functionality was originally created for John Shin's SHOP2
;;   graphical user interface.  In general, we expect it would be
;;   generally useful for an external system that needs access to lots
;;   of internal SHOP2 information.

;;   2003.4.21 (jwm) Added code to the theorem proving mechanism that
;;   invokes a routine called external-access-hook iff one is defined.
;;   This hook is intended to allow SHOP2 users to supply their own
;;   mechanisms for accessing external data structures.  If no
;;   external-access hook routine is supplied, this change has no
;;   effect.

;;   2003.4.1 (jwm) Added new keyword argument to SHOP2, :explanation.
;;   Defaults to nil; when true SHOP2 adds extra information at the
;;   end of each operator explaining how the preconditions for that
;;   operator were satisfied.  Currently supports only logical atoms,
;;   and, & or (no forall, not, eval, etc.).

;;   2003.3.4 (jwm) Enforced consistent capitalization of variables
;;   and function names (important for using SHOP2 with case-sensitive
;;   Lisp).  SHOP2 has not been extensively tested using
;;   case-sensitive Lisp, however.

; ****************** Revisions since the SHOP2 1.0 Release

;;   2002.2.8 (jwm) Fixed some minor issues that were requiring that
;;   you load SHOP2 before compiling it.  You don't have to do that
;;   any more.

;;   2002.12.20 (jwm) Tiny bug fix involving debugging code that
;;   didn't work with one of the state encodings (:bit).

;;;  2002.12.15 (jwm) Fixed the previous bug fix (see 2002.12.12)

;;;  2002.12.12 (jwm) Fixed subtle bug that was caused by unexpected
;;;  interaction between the new plan tree code (see 2002.9.27 below)
;;;  and existing (bad) delete-task-top-list code.

;;;  2002.11.1 (jwm) Fixed bug in retract-state-changes that was
;;;  causing errors when an operator attempted to delete and add the
;;;  same atom to the state (the error only arises during
;;;  backtracking).

;;;  2002.9.27 (jwm) Added new keyword parameter :plan-tree to
;;;  find-plans.  It defaults to nil; if true, the first return value
;;;  is a _list_ containing (1) the complete task decomposition tree
;;;  for the plan and (2) the plan itself.

;;;  2002.8.16 (jwm) Added code to seek-plans-null which invokes a
;;;  function called plan-found-hook if such a function is defined.
;;;  Useful for larger systems that invoke SHOP2 and want to perform
;;;  some action whenever a plan is found.

;;;  2002.7.12 (jwm) Added new global variable *all-problems* which stores
;;;  all of the problems that have been defined by defproblem or make-problem.

; ****************** Revisions prior to SHOP2 1.0 Release

;;;  2002.5.24 (jwm) Fixed bug involving operators that try to add
;;;  atoms to the state that are already true or delete operators from
;;;  a state that were already false; those operators caused strange
;;;  problems when backtracking.

;;;  2002.5.10 (jwm) Added new :state keyword to find-plans which
;;;  takes the same arguments that encode-states used to;
;;;  encode-states is no longer user.  I also fixed strip-nops so that
;;;  iNOP's are no longer included in the final plan.  I also fixed
;;;  eval terms (eval in the task list of a method).

;;;  2002.5.10 (dsn)  Removed the old verbosity code (since it is superseded by
;;;  SHOP-TRACE), and replaced it with code for :STATS, :PLANS, :LONG-PLANS,
;;;  etc.  I moved a small amount of the old verbosity code into SHOP-TRACE,
;;;  e.g., we now print a message if a traced operator violates a protection.
;;;  Also, I fixed the *VERSION* variable and put the right copyright/licensing
;;;  comments at the start of the file, to prepare for our software release.

;;;  2002.5.3 (jwm) Task lists in methods and in problem definitions
;;;  are now processed using the same mechanism.  The :ordered and
;;;  :task keywords are optional in both mechanisms and are implied
;;;  where omitted.  For example, the task list:
;;;;    (((a 1) (b 2))
;;;;     (:unordered (:immediate c 3) (d 4)))
;;;  is interpretted as:
;;;;   (:ordered (:ordered (:task a 1) (:task b 2))
;;;;             (:unordered (:task :immediate c 3) (:task d 4)))
;;;  Note that this approach is backward compatible with SHOP1,
;;;  which leaves out the :ordered and :task keywords, since those
;;;  keywords are implied.  It is _not_ backward compatible with
;;;  MSHOP which has the top-level task list always be unordered.

;;;  2002.5.3 (jwm) Deleted the check-for-loops feature because it was
;;;  never used much and stopped working many revisions ago.

;;;  2002.4.26 (jwm) Fixed bug in sort-by which reversed sort orders.
;;;  Incidentally, the change also makes the :which option return plans
;;;  in the order that they were found (rather than the reverse order).

;;;  2002.4.19 (jwm) Did more fine tuning of state code.  Improves speed,
;;;  especially with :bit and :hash encodings.

;;;  2002.4.7 (jwm) Added new option for encode-state, :bit, which
;;;  uses bit strings to represent states; casual testing suggests
;;;  that :bit is much slower than the other options and adds little
;;;  or no additional coverage.  It may improve with further tweaking,
;;;  however, so its staying in for now.

;;;  2002.4.7 (jwm) Fixed an idiosyncracy in axiom handling code which
;;;  led to strange behavior when an axiom has a single expression for
;;;  a tail rather than a list of expressions.  Axioms now work
;;;  correctly with either form.

;;;  2002.3.30 (jwm) Fixed a bug in the interaction between the new
;;;  state handling code and the existing code for protections.
;;;  Protections should now work like they did before the new state
;;;  code was introduced.

;;;  2002.3.29 (jwm) The :pshort argument now omits operators that
;;;  begin with !! rather than operators that have 0 cost.

;;;  2002.3.29 (jwm) It is now possible to use unbound variables in
;;;  methods when invoking an operator.  If those variables are bound
;;;  in the precondition of the operator then the associated step in
;;;  the final plan will use those bindings.

;;;  2002.3.26 (jwm) Updated print-current-state and
;;;  query-current-state so that they work with the modified state
;;;  representations.

;;;  2002.3.22 (jwm) Modified the :sort-by keyword for method
;;;  preconditions again; the new syntax is:
;;;    (:sort-by <value-expr> [ <comparison-expr> ] <precondition>)
;;;  For example, the following precondition would require that there
;;;  be values for the predicates foo and bar and would sort the
;;;  satisfiers in decreasing order of the product of the values of
;;;  those predicates:
;;;    (:sort-by (* ?x ?y) #'> (and (foo ?x) (bar ?y)))

;;;  2002.3.19 (uk) Added two new keywords that is to be used by the
;;;  keyword :sort-by. These are namely :asc and :dsc, which enable
;;;  sorting in either ascending or descending order.

;;;  2002.3.18 (jwm) Added new keyword for logical expressions,
;;;  :sort-by.  When seek-satisfiers encounters the expression
;;;  (:sort-by ?foo expr1), it seeks staisfiers for the expression
;;;  expr1 and then sorts the results by the number that they bind
;;;  ?foo too.  If a satisfier does not bind ?foo or binds ?foo to a
;;;  non-number, it is treated as 0 for sorting purposes.

;;;  2002.3.15 (jwm) Added new keyword argument, :time-limit.  When
;;;  :time-limit is a number, SHOP2 terminates when that number of
;;;  seconds of CPU time has elapsed (or when it gets done, whichever
;;;  comes first).  The limit is checked at each call to seek-plans,
;;;  so if there is a long gap between calls, the total CPU time of
;;;  planning may be greater than the time limit.

;;;  2002.3.15 (jwm) Added a new user function encode-state, which
;;;  changes the way that states are encoded.  Currently three values
;;;  are supported:
;;;
;;;    :hash encodes states as hash tables; memory efficient but slow
;;;
;;;    :list encodes states as lists; fastest but memory inefficient
;;;
;;;    :mixed encodes states as lists within hash tables; a compromise
;;;      between speed and memory effiency
;;;
;;;  The default behavior is :mixed.

;;;  2002.3.15 (jwm) Changed find-plans to return both the plans and
;;;  total CPU time used (in seconds) rather than just the plans.

;;;  2002.3.13 (jwm) Fixed bug in delete-task-top-list (list was being
;;;  destructively modified).

;;;  2002.3.10 (jwm) Isolated the code for manipulating states.
;;;  States are now destructively modified, and need to be explicitly
;;;  undone whenever backtracking occurs.  Hash tables (keyed by
;;;  predicate) are used to store state information.

;;;  2002.2.28 (jwm) Fixed minor bug in apply-method (some values
;;;  returned by force-immediate-reduction were being dropped).

;;;  2002.2.28 (jwm) Added some rounding code to print-stats because
;;;  it printed out very badly with some floating point numbers (this
;;;  has only become significant recently with the addition of various
;;;  cost related features see below).

;;;  2002.2.27 (dsn) get-top-tasks was running in quadratic time; I
;;;  replaced it with a linear-time algorithm.

;;;  2002.2.26 (dsn) in several places, SHOP2 was computing NEWDEPTH,
;;;  passing it as a parameter, and then taking (1- NEWDEPTH).  I
;;;  changed this so that SHOP2 just passes DEPTH as a parameter
;;;  instead.  Oddly enough, this minor change improved memory usage a
;;;  bit in my tests.

;;;  2002.2.26 (dsn) declared the local COST variables.  Removed
;;;  'CONTINUE from SEEK-PLANS and its subroutines, and fixed a case
;;;  where SEEK-PLANS was being called unnecessarily -- this seems to
;;;  improve both speed and memory usage

;;;  2002.2.26 (dsn) fixed problems with unused variables.

;;;  2002.2.26 (dsn) removed got-plan, and fixed some problems with
;;;  variable declarations.

;;;  2002.2.24 (dsn) replaced list-methods, list-operators, and
;;;  list-axioms with print-methods, print-operators, and print-axioms
;;;  -- functions that I had mentioned in an email but forgot to put
;;;  into this file!

;;;  2002.2.24 (dsn) mtrace, otrace, and atrace are gone; I replaced
;;;  them with functions named shop-trace and shop-untrace.

;;;  2002.2.23 (dsn) New debugging functions: mtrace, otrace, and
;;;  atrace, for tracing individual methods, operators, and axioms.
;;;  Also, modifications so that the domain name is irrelevant.

;;;  2002.2.22 (jwm) New keyword for find-plans, :optimize-cost,
;;;  defaults to nil, and if true uses branch-and-bound to find
;;;  optimal (minimum cost) results.  If the argument to
;;;  :optimize-cost is a number, results which are less than or equal
;;;  to that number are found.

;;;  2002.2.22 (dsn) Fixed MCL compatibility bug with seek-satisfiers.

;;;  2002.2.22 (dsn) Added debug printing code to apply-method

;;;  2002.2.15 (jwm) Costs for SHOP2 operators can now be arbitrary
;;;  eval expresssions, rather than just numbers.  Note that this
;;;  feature doesn't work with backward-compatible SHOP1 operators
;;;  (i.e., ones with no preconditions).

;;;  2002.2.8 (chiu) New debugging functions: query-current-state,
;;;  print-current-state, print-current-tasks, and print-current-plan

;;;  2002.2.8 (uk) Fix the the missing part in the if-then-else
;;;  structure in handling the axioms in the function do-conjunct

;;;  2002.1.2 (jwm) Added a check-for-loops keyword parameter to
;;;  find-plans (for symmetry with the other parameters which used to
;;;  be global variables, e.g., pshort.

;;;  2001.12.27 (jwm) Added the force-immediate function to resolve
;;;  some issues with combining ordered and unordered methods, q.v.

;;;  2001.12.27 (jwm) Some miscellaneous compatibility tweaks, e.g.,
;;;  the #+:lispworks code below.

;;;  2001.12.17 (jwm) Changed printing so that if find-plans is
;;;  invoked with :verbose 0, it prints absolutely nothing.  Before,
;;;  it always printed stats no matter what.  Now to get stats you
;;;  must explicitly include :stats in the verbosity list or give
;;;  :verbose a number greater than 0.

;;;  2001.12.17 (jwm) Changed !iNOP operator to automatically be
;;;  treated as if it has a :immediate before it.  This makes !iNOP's
;;;  more efficient in unordered lists and has no functional effects
;;;  because iNOP's never do anything.

;;;  2001.12.17 (jwm) Changed :pshort argument to find-plans such that
;;;  short printing is enabled when the argument is non-nil, rather
;;;  than when it is equal to 0.  This is more consistent with LISP
;;;  and with the other arguments to find-plans.

;;;  2001.12.17 (jwm) Bug fix for the :pshort argument; previously
;;;  when printing short, only the first plan was printed.  Now all
;;;  plans are printed.

;;;  2001.12.13 (ois) Changed the apply-operator function under the
;;;  assumption that at most one operator's precondition will be
;;;  satisfied every time.  Changed find-satisfiers to have an
;;;  optional parameter which is sent as just1 to seek-satisfiers.
;;;  Set this parameter to "t" when find-satisfiers is called to find
;;;  the satisfiers of an operator's preconditions, since we assume
;;;  that there will be at most one such satisfier.

;;;  2001.12.12 (jwm) Divided seek-plans into smaller functions such a
;;;  seek-plans-nonprimitive.  This is not a functional change, but it
;;;  should make it easier to edit seek-plans in the future.

;;;  2001.12.12 (ois) Added the capability to handle ANDs in
;;;  preconditions. Also changed return value of find-satisfiers from
;;;  'fail to nil in case of failure.

;;;  2001.12.05 (jwm) Added calls to standardize for methods and
;;;  operators.  Also rewrote unify1 to no longer standardize, because
;;;  all calls to unify now follow calls to standardize.

;;;  2001.11.28 (jwm) Added call to standardize when using axioms in
;;;  seek-satisfiers (primarily because recursive axioms were broken).
;;;  Also rewrote standardize to be more efficient (since it is called
;;;  more).

;;;  2001.11.22 (chiu) Added the assignment-term "assign".

;;;  2001.11.14 (chiu) Added *current-plan* and *current-tasks*
;;;  similar to *current-state* below.

;;;  2001.11.07 (chiu) Created global variable *current-state*,
;;;  updated in find-satisfiers, which records the current state;
;;;  handy for debugging.

;;;  2001.11.07  (jwm) Fixed the debug-print of the plans to use
;;;  the :plans tag rather than :stats

;;;  20001.11.07 (jwm) Created a new function variable-gensym which
;;;  generates a new variable _and_ sets the variable property for
;;;  that variable.  Replaced calls of the form (gensym "?... with
;;;  this new function

;;;  2001.07.05 (swm) Hacked on call some more to get process-method
;;;  to expand out method tails to something which actually gets
;;;  evaluated at run time.

;;;  2001.07.02 (swm) Removed !do-nothing operator from logistics
;;;  domain and re-ran regession tests on logistics and blocks-world
;;;  domains.  This finishes the previous change, and eliminates
;;;  Jason's hacked-in requirement to avoid nil tails in methods.

;;;  2001.07.01 (swm) Added default !NOP operator to make-domain and
;;;  defdomain.  Fixed handling of nil method tails in process-method.

;;;  2001.06.27 (swm) Additional syntactic changes to synchronize SHOP
;;;  2.0 syntax with the recently released JSHOP 1.0 Added macro call
;;;  to be used in place of eval.  Replaced make-problem with
;;;  defproblem.  Replaced make-problem-set with defproblem-set.
;;;  Replaced make-domain with defdomain.  NOTE BENE that these
;;;  changes were also propogated to the sample domain problem
;;;  definition files.

;;;  2001.06.06 (swm) Added preconditions to operators.  This required
;;;  modifying apply-operator to handle the new SHOP2 operator syntax,
;;;  and to test the preconditions before executing the delete and add
;;;  lists.  The precondition substitutions are interated over when
;;;  actually evaluating the delete and add lists.  Changed
;;;  operator-cost to access the correct element of the new SHOP 2
;;;  operator.  Modified process-operator to handle SHOP 2 operators,
;;;  and to re-write SHOP 1 operators into SHOP 2 syntax.

;;;  2001.06.05 (swm) Re-designed the control of debug output.  You
;;;  can still use a number which gives the same behavior as before,
;;;  or give a list of keywords (listed after the (defvar *verbosity*
;;;  declaration near the bottom of the file, which provides finer
;;;  control over the debug output.  A new macro is provided called
;;;  debug-print which replaces the old use of if statements with
;;;  tests on various numeric and other arguments.

;;;  2001.06.02 (swm) Replaced all occurances of :serial with
;;;  :ordered, and :parallel with :unordered to better represent the
;;;  actual meaning of that syntax.

;;;  2001.05.28 (swm) Modified make-domain to convert SHOP 1.x axioms
;;;  into SHOP 2 axioms with named branches if necessary.  Modified
;;;  seek-satisfiers to accomodate new axiom syntax.

;;;  2001.02.26 (swm) Modified process-method and apply-method to
;;;  accomodate the new branch labels in the method data structure:
;;;  (:method head label_1 precondition_1 task_list_1
;;;           ...  label_n precondition_n task_list_n)
;;;  NOTE: if the method does not have labels for the branches,
;;;  process-method will generate a label for each
;;;  branch of the form method-name-branch-number.

;;;  2001.01.02 (swm) Added strip-NOPs to remove the !NOP operator
;;;  that Jason hacked in to fix another problem.  This is only used
;;;  when pushing a partial plan onto the list *plans-found*. I'll go
;;;  back and fix the problem right at some later date.  The real
;;;  ugliness here is that to accomodate Jason's !NOP hack all of the
;;;  domains had to be modified so that methods which used to have ()
;;;  as the action now have to have (!NOP) or (!do-nothing).

;;;  2000.12.19 (swm) ACL and MCL expand backquotes in very different
;;;  ways.  The code that Jason wrote for incorporating :serial,
;;;  :parallel, :task, and :immediate into legacy SHOP :method tails
;;;  works for ACL, but cannot handle the MCL backquote expansions.
;;;  To get around that, added special backquote and comma reader
;;;  macros to a special readtable called *blue-light-readtable*, and
;;;  modified all regression SHOP domain files to bind to that
;;;  readtable during input under MCL.

;;;  2000.12.13  (swm) selectively replaced equal with = or eql to
;;;  speed up code.

;;;  2000.12.8   (swm) redefined the IMPLY case in seek-satisfiers per
;;;  the embedded comment.

;;;  2000.10.20 (swm) redefined variablep and primitivep as macros and
;;;  added preprocessing code to make-domain with the helper function
;;;  set-variable-property to set variable and primitive as properties
;;;  on the atom's plist to speed up code.

  "FIND-PLANS looks for solutions to the planning problem named PROBLEM.
   The keyword arguments are as follows:
     :WHICH tells what kind of search to do.  Its possible values are:
        :FIRST      - depth-first search, returning the first plan found.
        :ALL        - depth-first search for *all* plans.
        :SHALLOWEST - depth-first search for the shallowest plan in the
                      search space (this usually is also the shortest plan).
                      If there's more than one such plan, return the first.
        :ALL-SHALLOWEST - depth-first search for all shallowest plans.
        :ID-FIRST   - iterative deepening search, returning the first plan.
        :ID-ALL     - iterative deepening search for all shallowest plans.
     :VERBOSE says how much information to print about the plans SHOP2
              finds.  Its values can be any of the following:
        0 or NIL    - print nothing
        1 or :STATS - print some statistics on SHOP2's operation
        2 or :PLANS - print the stats and print all plans found, but omit
             operator costs and omit all operators whose names start with \"!!\"
        3 or :LONG-PLANS - print the stats and plans, including all operator
             costs and all operators (even those whose names start with \"!!\")
     :GC says whether to do a garbage collection before calling SEEK-PLANS
     :PLAN-TREE indicates whether or not to return a plan tree.
  RETURN VALUES:
     PLANS FOUND --- a list of plans.  Each plan is a list that alternates a
                     between instantiated operators and costs
     RUN TIME --- floating point value in seconds
       /if/ the PLAN-TREE keyword argument is supplied, there will be two
       additional return values:
     PLAN-TREES --- a list of plan trees, whose form is specified elsewhere.
     FINAL-STATES --- a list of final state structures, one per plan."
