     xxxxbbbbooooaaaarrrrdddd is a graphical chessboard that can serve  as  a  user
     interface  to  the  GNU  Chess and Crafty chess engines, the
     Internet  Chess  Servers,  electronic  mail   correspondence
     chess, or your own collection of saved games.

     As an interface to GNU Chess or Crafty, xboard lets you play
     a  game  against  the  machine,  set up arbitrary positions,
     force variations, or watch a game between two machines.

     As an interface to Crafty, xboard  also  lets  you  interac-
     tively analyze your stored games or set up and analyze arbi-
     trary positions.

     As an interface to the Internet Chess Server  (ICS),  xxxxbbbbooooaaaarrrrdddd
     ----iiiiccccssss  lets  you  play against other ICS users, observe games
     they are playing, or review games that  have  recently  fin-
     ished.  Most  of  the  "wild" chess variants on ICS are sup-
     ported, including bughouse.

     As an interface to  electronic  mail  correspondence  chess,
     xboard works with the ccccmmmmaaaaiiiillll(6) program.  See its manual page
     for instructions.

     You can also use xboard as  a  chessboard  to  play  through
     games.   It  will read and write game files and allow you to
     play through variations manually.  You can use it to  browse
     games  off  the  net  or  review games you have saved. These
     features are available at all times; if you want to use them
     without  starting  a  chess engine or connecting to the ICS,
     you can do so with the command xxxxbbbbooooaaaarrrrdddd ----nnnnccccpppp.

     To view games from a netnews reader like  rrrrnnnn(1)  or  xxxxrrrrnnnn(1),
     use the news reader's Save command and specify "|pxboard" as
     the save file name.  This pipes the article  to  ppppxxxxbbbbooooaaaarrrrdddd,  a
     simple  shell  script  that saves the article to a temporary
     file and runs xboard in  the  background.   See  the  script

     itself for more information.

     To move a piece, either drag it with the left mouse  button,
     or  click the left mouse button once on the piece, then once
     more on the destination square.  To drop a new  piece  on  a
     square  (when  applicable),  press  button  2  or 3 over the
     square and select from the popup menu.

     When xboard is iconized,  its  graphical  icon  is  a  white
     knight  if  it is White's turn to move, a black knight if it
     is Black's turn.  See IIIIccccoooonnnniiiizzzzeeee below  if  you  have  problems
     getting this feature to work.

             to  stop  playing, observing, or examining a game on
             ICS, use an  appropriate  command  from  the  Action

             Plays a game from a record file.  The "g" key  is  a
             keyboard equivalent.  A popup dialog prompts you for
             the file name.  If the file contains more  than  one
             game, a second popup dialog displays a list of games
             (with information drawn  from  their  PGN  tags,  if
             any), and you can select the one you want.  Alterna-
             tively, you can  load  the  _Nth  game  in  the  file
             directly  from  the  file name dialog, by typing the
             number _N after the file name, separated by a space.

             The game file parser will accept PGN (portable  game
             notation),  or in fact almost any file that contains
             moves in algebraic notation.  Notation of  the  form
             "P@f7"  is  accepted  for  piece-drops  in  bughouse
             games; this is a nonstandard extension to  PGN.   If
             the  file  includes  a PGN position (FEN tag), or an
             old-style xboard position diagram bracketed by "[--"
             and  "--]"  before  the  first move, the game starts
             from that position.  Text enclosed  in  parentheses,
             square  brackets,  or  curly braces is assumed to be
             commentary and is displayed in a pop-up window.  Any
             other  text  in the file is ignored.  PGN variations
             (enclosed in parentheses) are treated  as  comments;

             xboard  is  not  able  to walk variation trees.  The
             nonstandard PGN tag  [Variant  "varname"]  functions
             similarly  to  the -variant command-line option (see
             below), allowing games in certain chess variants  to
             be  loaded.   There is also a heuristic to recognize
             chess variants from the Event tag,  by  looking  for
             the  strings  that  the  Internet  Chess Servers put
             there when saving variant ("wild") games.

             popup  dialog prompts you for the file name.  If the
             game did not begin with the standard starting  posi-
             tion,  the  game file includes the starting position
             used.  Games are saved in  the  PGN  (portable  game
             notation)  format, unless the oldSaveStyle option is
             True, in which case they are saved in an older  for-
             mat  that  is  specific to xboard.  Both formats are
             human-readable, and both can be  read  back  by  the
             Load  Game  command.  Notation of the form "P@f7" is
             generated for piece-drops in bughouse games; this is
             a nonstandard extension to PGN.

             with  the  -ics  option,  and  use  the terminal you
             started it from to type commands  and  receive  text
             responses  from  the  chess server.  Useful ICS com-
             mands include _w_h_o to see who is logged on, _g_a_m_e_s  to
             see  what games are being played, _m_a_t_c_h to challenge
             another player to a  game,  _o_b_s_e_r_v_e  to  observe  an
             ongoing  game,  _e_x_a_m_i_n_e  or  _o_l_d_m_o_v_e_s  to  review  a
             recently completed game, and of course _h_e_l_p.

             Some special xboard features are activated when  you
             are  in  _e_x_a_m_i_n_e  or  _b_s_e_t_u_p  mode  on ICS.  See the
             descriptions of the menu commands Forward, Backward,
             Pause,  ICS  Client,  and Stop Examining below.  You
             can also issue  the  ICS  position-editing  commands
             with  the  mouse. Move pieces by dragging with mouse
             button 1.  To drop a new piece on  a  square,  press

             mouse button 2 or 3 over the square.  This brings up
             a menu of white pieces (button 2)  or  black  pieces
             (button  3).   Additional menu choices let you empty
             the square or clear the board.  Click on  the  White
             or  Black clock to set the side to play.  You cannot
             set the side to play or  drag  pieces  to  arbitrary
             squares while examining on ICC, but you can do so in
             bsetup mode on FICS.

             If you are playing a bughouse game on the  ICS,  you
             can  drop an offboard piece by pressing mouse button
             2 or 3 over an empty square  to  bring  up  a  piece
             menu.   It makes no difference which button you use.
             A list of the offboard pieces each player has avail-
             able is shown in the window title after the player's
             name.

             and  to change moves after backing up with the Back-

             In chess engine mode, the chess engine continues  to
             check moves for legality but does not participate in
             the game.  You can bring the chess engine back  into
             the  game by selecting Machine White, Machine Black,
             or Two Machines.

             In ICS mode, the moves are  not  sent  to  the  ICS:
             Edit  Game  takes  xboard out of ICS Client mode and
             lets you edit games locally.  If you  want  to  edit

             use the ICS _e_x_a_m_i_n_e command or start  an  ICS  match
             against yourself.

             delete a piece by dragging it off the board or drag-
             ging  an  empty  square on top of it.  To drop a new
             piece on a square, press mouse button 2  or  3  over
             the  square.   This brings up a menu of white pieces
             (button 2) or black pieces (button  3).   Additional
             menu  choices  let you empty the square or clear the
             board.  You can set the side to play next by  click-
             ing  on  the  White or Black indicator at the top of
             the screen.  Selecting Edit Position  causes  xboard

             Training mode lets you interactively guess the moves
             of a game for one of the players. You guess the next
             move of the game by playing the move on  the  board.
             If  the  move  played  matches  the next move of the
             game,  the  move  is  accepted  and  the  opponent's
             response  is  autoplayed.   If  the  move  played is
             incorrect, an error message is displayed.   You  can
             select this mode only while loading a game (that is,
             after selecting  Load  Game  from  the  File  menu).
             While  xboard  is  in  Training mode, the navigation
             buttons are disabled.

             Lets you edit the PGN (portable game notation)  tags
             for  the current game.  After editing, the tags must
             still conform to the PGN tag syntax:

                 <tag-section> ::= <tag-pair> <tag-section>
                             <empty>
                 <tag-pair> ::= [ <tag-name> <tag-value> ]
                 <tag-name> ::= <identifier>
                 <tag-value> ::= <string>

             See the PGN Standard for full details.  Here  is  an
             example:

                 [Event "Portoroz Interzonal"]
                 [Site "Portoroz, Yugoslavia"]
                 [Date "1958.08.16"]
                 [Round "8"]
                 [White "Robert J. Fischer"]
                 [Black "Bent Larsen"]
                 [Result "1-0"]

             Any characters that do not  match  this  syntax  are
             silently   ignored.   Note  that  the  PGN  standard
             requires all games to have at least the  seven  tags
             shown above.  Any that you omit will be filled in by
             xboard with "?" (unknown value), or "-"  (inapplica-
             ble value).

             If this mode is on in ICS mode,  xboard  creates  an
             extra window that you can use for typing in ICS com-
             mands.  The input box is especially  useful  if  you
             want to type in something long or do some editing on
             your input, because  output  from  ICS  doesn't  get
             mixed  in  with  your typing as it would in the main
             terminal window.

     PPPPaaaauuuusssseeee   Pauses updates to the board, and if you are  playing
             against  a  local  chess  engine,  also  pauses your
             clock.  To continue, select  Pause  again,  and  the
             display  will  automatically  update  to  the latest
             position.  The [P] button and keyboard "p"  key  are
             equivalents.

             If you select Pause when you are playing  against  a
             local  chess  engine  and  it  is not your move, the
             engine's clock will continue  to  run  and  it  will
             eventually  make  a move, at which point both clocks
             will stop.  Since board updates are paused, however,
             you  will not see the move until you exit from Pause
             mode (or select Forward).  This behavior is meant to
             simulate adjournment with a sealed move.

             If you select Pause while you are in _e_x_a_m_i_n_e mode on
             ICS,  you  can  step  backward  and  forward  in the
             current history of the examined game without affect-
             ing the other observers and examiners.  Select Pause
             again to reconnect yourself to the current state  of
             the game on ICS.

             If you select Pause while you are  loading  a  game,
             the  game  stops  loading.   You can load more moves
             manually by selecting Forward, or  resume  automatic
             loading by selecting Pause again.

             Steps backward through a series of remembered moves.
             The  [<] button and the "b" key are equivalents.  In
             addition, pressing the Control key  steps  back  one

             In most modes, Back to Start only lets you look back

             If this option is on and one player runs out of time
             before the other, xboard will automatically call his
             flag, claiming a win on time.   In  ICS  mode,  Auto
             Flag will only call your opponent's flag, not yours,
             and the ICS may award you a draw instead of a win if
             you  have  insufficient  mating  material.  In local
             chess engine mode, xboard may call  either  player's
             flag and will not take material into account.

             doing something else (such as observing or playing a
             game of your own) when one starts.   The  games  are
             displayed  from  the  point of view of the player on
             your gnotify list; that is, his pawns move from  the
             bottom  of  the window towards the top.  Exceptions:
             If both players in a game are on your gnotify  list,
             if  your  ICS  _h_i_g_h_l_i_g_h_t variable is set to 0, or if
             the ICS you are  using  does  not  properly  support
             observing  from  Black's point of view, you will see
             the game from White's point of view.

             If you are playing a game on the ICS, the  board  is
             always  oriented  at  the  start of the game so that
             your pawns  move  from  the  bottom  of  the  window
             towards  the  top.  Otherwise, the starting orienta-
             tion is determined  by  the  flipView  command  line
             option;  if it is False (the default), White's pawns
             move from bottom to top at the start of  each  game;
             if  it  is  True,  Black's pawns move from bottom to
             top.

             game from the one it is  currently  displaying),  it
             retrieves  the list of past moves from the ICS.  You
             can then review the moves with the Forward and Back-
             ward  commands  or  save  them  with Save Game.  You
             might want to  turn  off  this  option  if  you  are
             observing  several blitz games at once, to keep from
             wasting time and network bandwidth fetching the move
             lists  over  and over.  When you turn this option on
             from the menu, xboard immediately fetches  the  move
             list of the current game (if any).

             after moves you make or moves read from a saved game

             but on some systems you can change  it  to  a  sound
             file using the soundMove option; see below.

             If you turn on this option when  using  xboard  with
             the Internet Chess Server, you will probably want to
             give the _s_e_t _b_e_l_l _0 command to the ICS, since other-
             wise the ICS will ring the terminal bell after every
             move.

             When this option is on, an  alarm  sound  is  played
             when  your clock counts down to the icsAlarmTime (by
             default, 5 seconds) in an ICS game.  For games  with
             time  controls  that include an increment, the alarm
             will sound each time the clock counts  down  to  the
             icsAlarmTime.   By  default,  the alarm sound is the
             terminal bell, but on some systems you can change it
             to  a sound file using the soundIcsAlarm option; see
             below.

             xboard is used instead.  The old position  style  is
             more human-readable than FEN; the old game style has
             no particular advantages.

             will be highlighted with a  special  color  (red  by
             default).   When it is your turn, if your registered
             move is legal, xboard will send it  to  ICS  immedi-
             ately; if not, it will be ignored and you can make a
             different move.  If you change your mind about  your
             premove,  either  make  a different move, or double-
             click on any piece to cancel the move entirely.

             The first line above enables graphical icons in mmmmwwwwmmmm;
             you  don't  need  it  if you already have them.  The
             next two lines force the white knights to  come  out
             white  and  the  black knights black.  Unfortunately
             these resources can't be set from inside xboard; you
             have to set them in your .Xdefaults.

     You can add or remove  xboard  shortcut  keys  using  the  X
     resource  _f_o_r_m._t_r_a_n_s_l_a_t_i_o_n_s.   Here  is  an  example of what
     would go in your .Xdefaults file:

         XBoard*form.translations: \
             Shift<Key>?: AboutGameProc() \n \
          <Key>y: AcceptProc() \n \
          <Key>n: DeclineProc() \n \
          <Key>i: NothingProc()

     Binding a key to  NothingProc  makes  it  do  nothing,  thus
     removing  it  as  a shortcut key.  The xboard functions that
     can be bound to keys are:

     This section documents the command-line options  to  xboard.
     You can set these options in two ways: by typing them on the



GNU         Last change: $Date: 2004/06/17 22:05:11 $          17






Games and Demos                                         xboard(6)



     shell command line you use to start xboard,  or  by  setting
     them  as  X  resources  (typically in your .Xdefaults file).
     Many of the options cannot be changed while xboard  is  run-
     ning;  others  set  the  initial  state of items that can be
     changed with the Options menu.

     Most of the options have both a long name and a short  name.
     To  turn  a  boolean option on or off from the command line,
     either give its long name followed  by  the  value  True  or
     False (-_l_o_n_g_O_p_t_i_o_n_N_a_m_e True), or give just the short name to
     turn the option on (-_o_p_t), or the short name preceded by "x"
     to  turn  the  option  off  (-x_o_p_t).   For options that take
     strings or numbers as values, you can use the long or  short
     option names interchangeably.

     Each option corresponds to an X resource with the same name,
     so  if you like, you can set options in your ._X_d_e_f_a_u_l_t_s file
     or in a file named  XBoard  in  your  home  directory.   For
     options  that  have two names, the longer one is the name of
     the corresponding X resource; the short name is  not  recog-
     nized.  To turn a boolean option on or off as an X resource,
     give its long name followed  by  the  value  True  or  False
     (XBoard*_l_o_n_g_O_p_t_i_o_n_N_a_m_e:  True).

     All of these options apply to both the GNU Chess and  Crafty

             Each  player  begins  with  his  clock  set  to  the
             timeControl  period.  Default: 5 minutes.  The addi-
             tional options movesPerSession and timeIncrement are
             mutually exclusive.

             When both players have made movesPerSession moves, a
             new  timeControl  period  is  added  to both clocks.
             Default: 40 moves.

             If this  option  is  specified,  movesPerSession  is
             ignored.  Instead, after each player's move, timeIn-
             crement seconds are added to his clock. Use -timeIn-
             crement  0 if you want to require the entire game to
             be played in one timeControl period, with no  incre-
             ment.   Default: -1, which specifies movesPerSession
             mode.

             amount  of  time  searching  for  each of its moves.
             Without this option, the engine chooses  its  search
             time based on the number of moves and amount of time
             remaining until the next time control.  Setting this

             of time remaining until the next time control.  With

             In games between two chess  engines,  firstChessPro-
             gram  normally  plays white.  (This is a change from
             earlier versions of  xboard.)   If  this  option  is
             True,  firstChessProgram  plays  black.  In a multi-

             The string that is sent  to  initialize  each  chess
             engine for a new game.  Default:
                 new
                 random
             Setting this option from the command line is tricky,
             because  you  must  type in real newline characters,
             including one at the end.  In most shells you can do
             this  by entering a "\" character followed by a new-
             line.  It is easier to  set  the  option  from  your
             .Xdefaults  file;  in  that case you can include the
             character sequence "\n" in the string, and  it  will
             be converted to a newline.

             If you change this option, don't remove the _n_e_w com-
             mand; it is required by all chess engines to start a
             new game.

             You can remove  the  _r_a_n_d_o_m  command  if  you  like;

             including  it causes GNU Chess to randomize its move
             selection slightly so that it doesn't play the  same
             moves  in every game. Even without _r_a_n_d_o_m, GNU Chess
             randomizes its choice  of  moves  from  its  opening
             book.  Crafty ignores this command; it randomizes by
             default.

             You can also try adding other commands to the  init-
             String;  see  the  GNU Chess or Crafty documentation

             If the option is False, xboard kills off  the  chess
             engine  after every game and starts it again for the
             next game. If the  option  is  True  (the  default),
             xboard starts the chess engine only once and uses it
             repeatedly  to  play  multiple  games.   Some  chess
             engines  may  not work properly when reuse is turned
             on, such as versions of Crafty  earlier  than  12.0,
             but  otherwise  new games will start faster if it is
             left on.

             version-number is 2.  In version 1,  the  "protover"

             If this option is set, xboard communicates with  the
             ICS  through  the given character I/O device instead
             of opening a TCP connection.   Use  this  option  if
             your  system does not have any kind of Internet con-
             nection itself (not even a SLIP or PPP  connection),
             but you do have dialup access (or a hardwired termi-
             nal line) to an Internet service provider from which
             you can telnet to the ICS.

             The support for this option in  xboard  is  minimal.
             You need to set all communication parameters and tty
             modes before you enter xboard.

             Use a script something like this:

                 stty raw -echo 9600 > /dev/tty00
                 xboard -ics -icscomm /dev/tty00

             Here replace /_d_e_v/_t_t_y_0_0 with the name of the  device
             that  your  modem is connected to. You might have to
             add several more options  to  these  stty  commands.

             These options set the colors  used  when  colorizing
             ICS messages.  All ICS messages are grouped into one
             of these  categories:   shout,  sshout,  channel  1,
             other  channel,  kibitz,  tell,  challenge,  request
             (including abort, adjourn, draw,  pause,  and  take-
             back), seek, or normal (all other messages).

             Each foreground or background argument can be one of
             the  following:   black,  red,  green, yellow, blue,
             magenta, cyan, white, or  default.   Here  "default"
             means  the default foreground or background color of
             your xterm.  Bold can be 1 or 0.  If  background  is
             omitted, "default" is assumed; if bold is omitted, 0
             is assumed.

             Here is an example of how to set the colors in  your
             .Xdefaults  file.   The  colors  shown  here are the
             default values;  you  will  get  them  if  you  turn
             -colorize on without specifying your own colors.

             If any of the sound options is set to "$", the event
             rings the terminal bell by sending a ^G character to

             If the loadGameFile option is set, xboard loads  the
             specified  game  file at startup.  The file name "-"
             specifies the standard input.  If there is more than
             one  game  in the file, xboard pops up a menu of the
             available games, with entries  based  on  their  PGN
             (portable game notation) tags.  If the loadGameIndex
             option is set to _N, the menu is suppressed  and  the
             _Nth  game  found  in the file is loaded immediately.
             The menu is also suppressed if matchMode is  enabled
             or  if  the  game file is a pipe; in these cases the
             first game in the file is loaded  immediately.   Use
             the  ppppxxxxbbbbooooaaaarrrrdddd  shell script if you want to pipe files

             values (with no spaces) as the argument.  You do not
             need  to  provide  all  the values; for any you omit
             from the end of the list, defaults  are  taken  from
             the  nearest  built-in size.  The value n1 gives the
             piece size, n2 the width of the black border between
             squares,  n3  the desired size for the _c_l_o_c_k_F_o_n_t, n4
             the desired size for the _c_o_o_r_d_F_o_n_t, n5  the  desired
             size  for  the default _f_o_n_t, n6 the smallLayout flag
             (0 or 1), and n7 the tinyLayout flag (0 or  1).  All
             dimensions  are  in  pixels.   If the border between
             squares  is  eliminated  (0  width),   the   various
             highlight options will not work, as there is nowhere
             to draw the highlight.   If  smallLayout  is  1  and
             _t_i_t_l_e_I_n_W_i_n_d_o_w  is  True,  the window layout is rear-
             ranged to make more room for the title.  If tinyLay-
             out is 1, the labels on the menu bar are abbreviated
             to one character each and the buttons in the  button
             bar are made narrower.

             If Auto Flip View is not set, or if you are  observ-
             ing  but not participating in a game, then the posi-
             tioning of the board  at  the  start  of  each  game
             depends  on  the  flipView  option.   If flipView is
             False (the default), the board is positioned so that
             the  white pawns move from the bottom to the top; if
             True, the black pawns move from the  bottom  to  the
             top.   In any case, the Flip menu option can be used
             to flip the board after the game starts.

             In the font selection algorithm, a nonscalable  font

             value of 0 will use a nonscalable font only if it is
             exactly the right size; a  large  value  (say  1000)
             will  force  a nonscalable font to always be used if
             available.  Default: 4.

             These options control what piece images xboard uses.
             The  xboard  distribution includes one set of pixmap
             pieces in xpm format, in the directory _p_i_x_m_a_p_s,  and
             two  sets  of  bitmap  pieces  in xbm format, in the
             directories  _b_i_t_m_a_p_s  and  _b_i_t_m_a_p_s._x_c_h_e_s_s.    Pixmap
             pieces  give  a better appearance on the screen: the
             white pieces have dark borders, and the black pieces
             have opaque internal details.  With bitmaps, neither
             piece color has a border, and the  internal  details
             are  transparent;  you see the square color or other
             background color through them.

             If xboard is configured and  compiled  on  a  system
             that  includes libXpm, the X pixmap library, the xpm
             pixmap pieces are compiled in  as  the  default.   A
             different  xpm  piece set can be selected at runtime
             with the -pixmapDirectory option, or a bitmap  piece
             set   can  be  selected  with  the  -bitmapDirectory
             option.

             If xboard is configured and  compiled  on  a  system
             that  does  not include libXpm (or the --disable-xpm
             option is given to the configure program), the  bit-
             map  pieces  are  compiled in as the default.  It is
             not possible to use xpm pieces  in  this  case,  but
             pixmap  pieces in another format called "xim" can be
             used by  giving  the  -pixmapDirectory  option.   Or
             again,  a different bitmap piece set can be selected
             with the -bitmapDirectory option.

             Files in the bitmapDirectory must be named  as  fol-
             lows:   The  first  character of a piece bitmap name
             gives the piece it represents (p, n, b, r, q, or k),
             the  next  characters  give  the size in pixels, the
             following character indicates whether the  piece  is
             solid  or  outline  (s  or  o), and the extension is
             ".bm".  For example, a solid 80x80 knight  would  be
             named  "n80s.bm".  The outline bitmaps are used only
             in monochrome mode.  If bitmap pieces  are  compiled

             in  and  the  bitmapDirectory is missing some files,
             the compiled in pieces are used instead.

             If the bitmapDirectory option is given, it  is  also
             possible  to  replace xboard's icons and menu check-
             mark,  by  supplying  files  named  "icon_white.bm",
             "icon_black.bm", and "checkmark.bm".

             You can import pixmap pieces from the ZZZZIIIIIIIICCCCSSSS  distri-
             bution by using the zzzziiiicccc2222xxxxppppmmmm program to convert them.
             This program produces both xpm and xim  pixmaps,  so
             you can use these pieces even if you do not have xpm
             support compiled into your xboard.  ZIICS provides a
             large  number  of piece sets to choose from.  Here's
             how to import them:

             2) Unzip it into a directory, for example:

                   unzip -L ziics131.exe -d ~/ziics

             3) Pick a chess set you want to use, for example the
             FRITZ4  set.  Create a directory to hold the pieces,
             then run the zzzziiiicccc2222xxxxppppmmmm program to create the pieces:

                   mkdir ~/fritz4
                   cd ~/fritz4
                   zic2xpm ~/ziics/fritz4.*

             (The zzzziiiicccc2222xxxxppppmmmm  program  is  in  the  directory  where
             xboard  was  compiled,  in case you didn't do a _m_a_k_e
             _i_n_s_t_a_l_l.)

             4) Now, just add the  ----ppppiiiixxxxmmmmaaaappppDDDDiiiirrrreeeeccccttttoooorrrryyyy  option  when
             you start xboard:

                  xboard -pixmapDirectory ~/fritz4

     Crafty  is   a   chess   engine   written   by   Bob   Hyatt
     (hyatt@cis.uab.edu).   You  can  use  XBoard  to play a game
     against Crafty, hook Crafty up to an ICS, or use  Crafty  to
     interactively analyze games and positions for you.

     Crafty is a strong, rapidly  evolving  chess  program.  This
     rapid  pace  of development is good, because it means Crafty
     is always getting better.  This can sometimes cause problems
     with backwards compatibility, but usually the latest version
     of Crafty will work well with the latest version of  xboard.
     Crafty   can   be  obtained  from  its  author's  FTP  site:
     ftp://ftp.cis.uab.edu/hyatt/.

     To use Crafty with XBoard, give the -fcp and -fd options  as
     follows,  where _c_r_a_f_t_y'_s-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y is the directory in which
     you installed Crafty and placed its book and  other  support
     files.

         xboard -fcp crafty -fd _c_r_a_f_t_y'_s-_d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y

     By default, xxxxbbbbooooaaaarrrrdddd ----iiiiccccssss communicates with an Internet  Chess
     Server  by opening a TCP socket directly from the machine it
     is running on to the ICS.  If there is  a  firewall  between
     your  machine  and  the ICS, this won't work.  Here are some
     recipes for getting around common kinds of  firewalls  using
     special  options to xboard.  Important: See the paragraph in
     the LIMITATIONS section below about extra echoes.

     Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but  you  can
     telnet  to  a  firewall  host,  log in, and then telnet from
     there  to  ICS.   Let's   say   the   firewall   is   called
     fire.wall.com.  Set command-line options as follows:

         xboard -ics -icshost fire.wall.com -icsport 23



GNU         Last change: $Date: 2004/06/17 22:05:11 $          35






Games and Demos                                         xboard(6)



     Or in your .Xdefaults file:

         XBoard*internetChessServerHost: fire.wall.com
         XBoard*internetChessServerPort: 23

     Then when you run xboard in ICS mode, you will  be  prompted
     to log in to the firewall host.  (This works because port 23
     is the standard telnet login service.)  Log in, then  telnet
     to  ICS,  using a command like _t_e_l_n_e_t _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m _5_0_0_0, or
     whatever command the firewall  provides  for  telnetting  to
     port 5000.

     If your firewall lets  you  telnet  (or  rlogin)  to  remote
     hosts,  but  doesn't  let  you telnet to port 5000, you will
     have to find some other host outside the firewall that  does
     let  you do this, and hop through it.  For instance, suppose
     you have an account at foo.edu.  Follow  the  recipe  above,
     but  instead  of  typing  _t_e_l_n_e_t  _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m  _5_0_0_0 to the
     firewall, type _t_e_l_n_e_t _f_o_o._e_d_u (or _r_l_o_g_i_n  _f_o_o._e_d_u),  log  in
     there, and then type _t_e_l_n_e_t _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m _5_0_0_0.

     Exception: chessclub.com itself  lets  you  connect  to  the
     chess  server on the default telnet port (23), which is what
     you get if you don't specify a port to the  telnet  program.
     But the other chess servers don't allow this.

     Suppose that you can't telnet directly to ICS, but  you  can
     use  rsh  to  run programs on a firewall host, and that host
     can telnet  to  ICS.   Let's  say  the  firewall  is  called
     rsh.wall.com.  Set command-line options as follows:

         xboard -ics -gateway rsh.wall.com -icshost chessclub.com

     Or in your .Xdefaults file:

         XBoard*gateway: rsh.wall.com
         XBoard*internetChessServerHost: chessclub.com

     Then when you run xboard in ICS mode, it will connect to the
     ICS  by  using  rsh  to run the command _t_e_l_n_e_t _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m
     _5_0_0_0 on host rsh.wall.com.

     Suppose that you can telnet anywhere you want, but you  have
     to run a special program called pppptttteeeellllnnnneeeetttt to do so.

     First, we'll  consider  the  easy  case,  in  which  _p_t_e_l_n_e_t
     _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m  _5_0_0_0  gets  you  to the chess server. In this
     case set command line options as follows:

         xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet

     Or in your .Xdefaults file:

         XBoard*useTelnet: true
         XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet

     Then when you run xboard in ICS mode, it will issue the com-
     mand _p_t_e_l_n_e_t _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m _5_0_0_0 to connect to the ICS.

     Next, suppose that _p_t_e_l_n_e_t _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m _5_0_0_0 doesn't  work;
     that  is,  your  ptelnet  program doesn't let you connect to
     alternative ports.  In this case, you will have to find some
     other  host  outside the firewall that does let you do this,
     and hop through it.   For  instance,  suppose  you  have  an
     account at foo.edu.  Set command line options as follows:

         xboard -ics -telnet -telnetProgram ptelnet -icshost foo.edu -icsport ""

     Or in your .Xdefaults file:

         XBoard*useTelnet: true
         XBoard*telnetProgram: ptelnet
         XBoard*internetChessServerHost: foo.edu
         XBoard*internetChessServerPort:

     Then when you run xboard in ICS mode, it will issue the com-
     mand  _p_t_e_l_n_e_t _f_o_o._e_d_u to connect to your account at foo.edu.
     Log in there, then type _t_e_l_n_e_t _c_h_e_s_s_c_l_u_b._c_o_m _5_0_0_0.

     ICC timestamp and FICS timeseal do  not  work  through  many
     firewalls.   You  can use them only if your firewall gives a
     clean TCP connection with a full 8-bit wide path.   If  your
     firewall  allows  you  to  get out only by running a special
     telnet program, you can't use timestamp or  timeseal  across
     it.   But if you have access to a computer just outside your
     firewall, and you have much lower  netlag  when  talking  to
     that  computer  than to the ICS, it might be worthwhile run-
     ning timestamp there.  Follow  the  instructions  above  for
     hopping  through a host outside the firewall (foo.edu in the
     example), but run timestamp or timeseal on that host instead
     of telnet.

     Suppose that you have a SOCKS firewall that requires you  to
     go  through  some  extra  level of authentication, but after
     that will give you a clean 8-bit wide TCP connection to  the
     chess  server.   In  that  case, you could make a socksified
     version of xboard and run that.  If you are using  timestamp
     or  timeseal, you will need to socksify it, not xboard; this
     may be difficult seeing that ICC and  FICS  do  not  provide
     source  code  for  these programs.  Socksification is beyond
     the scope of this document, but see the SOCKS  Web  site  at
     http://www.socks.nec.com/how2socksify.html.

     Game and position files are found in the directory named  by
     the  CHESSDIR environment variable.  If this variable is not
     set, the current working directory is used.  If CHESSDIR  is
     set,  xboard  actually  changes  its  working  directory  to
     $CHESSDIR, so any files written by the chess engine will  be
     placed there too.

     There is no way for two people running copies of  xboard  to
     play  each  other  without  going through the Internet Chess
     Server.

     Under some circumstances, your ICS password  may  be  echoed
     when you log on.

     If you are connecting to the ICS by running  telnet,  times-
     tamp,  or timeseal on an Internet provider or firewall host,
     you may find that each line you type is echoed back an extra
     time  after  you hit Return.  If your Internet provider is a
     Unix system, you can probably turn its echo  off  by  typing
     _s_t_t_y  -_e_c_h_o  after  you  log  in,  and/or  typing  ^E-Return
     (control-E followed by the Return key) to the telnet program
     after  you  have  logged  into ICS.  It is a good idea to do
     this if you can, because otherwise the extra echo can  occa-
     sionally confuse xboard's parsing routines.

     The game parser recognizes only algebraic notation.

     The internal move legality tester does not look at the  game
     history,  so  in some cases it misses illegal castling or en
     passant captures.  It permits castling with the king on  the
     d  file  because  this is possible in some "wild 1" games on
     ICS.  However, if you attempt an illegal move when  using  a
     chess  engine  or the ICS, xboard will accept the error mes-
     sage that comes  back,  undo  the  move,  and  let  you  try
     another.

     Fischer Random castling is not understood.  You can probably
     play Fischer Random chess successfully on ICS by typing cas-
     tling moves into the ICS Interaction window, but  they  will
     not  be  animated  correctly,  and  saved  games will not be
     loaded correctly if castling occurs.

     FEN positions saved by xboard never include correct informa-
     tion  about whether castling is legal or how many half-moves
     have been made since the last irreversible move,  and  some-
     times  may not correctly indicate when en passant capture is
     available.

     The mate detector does not understand that non-contact  mate
     is  not  really  mate  in  bughouse.   The only problem this
     causes while playing is minor: a "#" (mate indicator)  char-
     acter  will  show  up after a non-contact mating move in the
     move list; xboard will not assume the game is over  at  that
     point.   However,  if you are editing a game, Edit Game mode
     will be terminated by a non-contact mate.

     Some xboard functions may not  work  with  versions  of  GNU
     Chess  earlier  than 4.0, patchlevel 77, or with versions of
     Crafty earlier than 15.11.  A few functions  work  with  GNU
     Chess but not Crafty, or vice versa.

     The menus may not work if your keyboard is in Caps  Lock  or
     Num  Lock  mode.  This seems to be a problem with the Athena
     menu widget, not an xboard bug.

     Also see the ToDo file included with  the  distribution  for
     many   other  possible  bugs,  limitations,  and  ideas  for
     improvement that have been suggested.

     Mark Williams contributed the initial (WinBoard-only) imple-
     mentation of many new features added to both XBoard and Win-
     Board  in  version  4.1.0,  including  copy/paste,  premove,
     icsAlarm,  autoFlipView,  training  mode,  auto  raise,  and
     blindfold. Ben Nye contributed X copy/paste code for XBoard.

     Hugh Fisher added animated piece  movement  to  xboard,  and
     Henrik  Gram  added  it  to WinBoard.  Frank McIngvale added
     click/click moving,  the  Analysis  modes,  piece  flashing,
     ZIICS  import,  and ICS text colorization to xboard.  Jochen
     Wiedmann ported xboard to the Amiga, creating AAAAmmmmyyyyBBBBooooaaaarrrrdddd,  and
     converted  the  documentation to texinfo.  Elmar Bartel con-
     tributed the new piece bitmaps for version 3.2.  Evan  Welsh
     wrote  ccccmmmmaaaaiiiillll....  John Chanak contributed the initial implemen-
     tation of ICS mode.  The color  scheme  and  the  old  80x80
