     zzzziiiicccc2222xxxxppppmmmm converts one or more ZIICS piece files into a format
     that  can  be  used  by  XBoard.   If you give more than one
     filename, be aware that multiple sets of the same size  can-
     not exist in one directory. Multiple sets of different sizes
     can exist in a single directory.

     If you wanted  to  make  a  directory  containing  the  sets
     SET2.V32, SET2.V40, SET2.V50, and SET2.V56, all of which are
     located in ~/ziics, you could do:

           mkdir Sets
           cd Sets
           zic2xpm ~/ziics/SET2.*

     You would then run XBoard like this:

          xboard -pixmap Sets
