The 80x80 bitmaps in this directory are taken from the XChess program,
which was written and is copyrighted by Wayne Christopher.

The 64x64 set and 40x40 set were derived by scaling the 80x80 set and
touching up the results by hand with a bitmap editor.  icon_white.bm
and icon_black.bm are 32x32 knights made in the same way.
checkmark.bm is a copy of the xlogo11 bitmap from the MIT X
distribution.
