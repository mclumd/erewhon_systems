This is a sample zippy.lines file for xboard/WinBoard 4.0.4 or later.
Text before the first caret, like this text, is a comment.
^
Here is the first saying.  Sayings are separated by caret characters,
like the character that appears on the next line.
^
Here is the second saying.
^
Here is saying #3.  Note you don't need newlines before the caret characters.^
Here is saying #4 -- note that it's okay for a saying
to extend across more than one line.  The line breaks are ignored.
^Saying #5: You don't need newlines after the caret characters either,
but don't put two carets in a row.
^
Our sixth bit of wisdom is that you can use ASCII NUL characters
(character code \000) instead of carets, but carets are easier to deal with
in most text editors.  In version 4.0.3 and earlier, carets did not work;
only NULs were allowed.
^
The seventh thing you should remember is that any saying more than 250
characters long will not be used.  Therefore, because this saying is
more than 250 characters long, it will never be used.  This is an
extra sentence to make the saying more than 250 characters long so
that the previous sentence will be true.
^
The eighth item to know is that when you are testing, you had better have 
several valid sayings in your file; for various reasons, having too few 
sayings can cause Zippy to get into an endless loop, or to be very slow.
^
As the ninth and final saying, let me add that you need a caret
at the end of the file; any junk after the last caret is ignored.
