#
# This script saves its standard input to a temporary file and invokes
# "xboard -loadGameFile file &" on the file.  Although it is possible
# to pipe games directly into xboard using "xboard -lgf -", this
# script is nicer in two ways:  (1) xboard can seek on the temporary
# file, so the popup game list, Load Previous Game, and Reload Same
# Game all work.  (2) The script runs xboard in the background and
# exits.  So if you save a news article by piping it into this script,
# you immediately get back control of your news reader.
#
# The script turns on -noChessProgram mode by default.  If you want a
# chess program started, give the -xncp option.
