Wish list for the new J-Alma:

1)	ability to embed comments

2)	control in some manner when a rule can or cannot fire; when groups of
	facts can be submitted to some rule and the results all be added to DB
	simultaneously; example -- fif(forAll(X, if(A(X), then B(X))), then C).

3)	handle the full breadth of structures that Prolog can handle, in 
	particular, lists such as partially instantiated lists.
