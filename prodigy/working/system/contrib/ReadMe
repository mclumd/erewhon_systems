that add various features to the system. These should be small additions that
fit comfortably in one file - larger additions such as explanation-based
learning belong in a separate subdirectory of the system.

Please identify the following in a section at the top of each file:

 - the purpose of the file
 - the author, or someone to contact with bugs or suggestions
 - a change log if appropriate.
