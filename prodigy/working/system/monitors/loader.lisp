;;; File loader.lisp is the loader file for the Prodigy module that
;;; allows the planner to sense the environment during planning (see
;;; sensing.lisp), to interleave the execution of plan steps with planning
;;; itself (see execute.lisp), and to dynamically monitor the environment
;;; according to the planning rationale so that replanning can be performed
;;; during the planning process as the state changes. The software that
;;; performs experiments for various monitors is in test-battery.lisp and
;;; test-gtrans.lisp. The system works with and without the Graphical User
;;; Interface (see files monitor.tcl and overload.tcl for implementation).
