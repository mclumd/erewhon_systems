NOTE that this file pertains to the old watchdog procedure that was used during
the Prodigy/ForMAT TIE using domain tfs. It is obsolete at this time except for
anyone wishing to replicate the previous behavior of the system.


In Lisp:

    load loader.lisp

make 2 xterms:

    cd $fmat
    xterm -title ForMAT -n ForMAT &

    cd Watch.dog
    xterm -title "Watch Dog" -n  "Watch Dog" -r &

In the directory where the watchdog code is, do the following in two
different xterms:

1. In second xterm, do
  
    ./watchdog.sh /tmp/PRODIGY

2. In Lisp, call 

    (start-prodigy-front-end)

3. In the other xterm, do 

    Watch.dog/fake-format.sh /tmp/PRODIGY PRODIGY*

(Can also be called with a specific filename instead of PRODIGY*,
e.g. PRODIGY.04-01-96.1630)

After terminating everything, do from first xterm

    ./reset-watchdog.sh /tmp/PRODIGY

----------------------------------------------------------------------------

One can also run the system without having an X-environment. Just do not use
the xterm commands above and use the call "./watchdog.sh /tmp/PRODIGY NO &" in
place of the corresponding one above. The optional NO argument blocks the
script from using the xterm and xbiff programs. All interaction is through the
file system and text standard-output.
