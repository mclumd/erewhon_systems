To use Prodigy/Agent for outputting plans in Kerkez's format with intermediate
states, do the following. Set *interactive-loading* to t in
prodigy/working/system-loader.lisp. Load both the monitor and Prodigy/Agent
modules. Then perform the following load operation.

(load 
 "w:/My Documents/prodigy/working/system/agent/changed/plan2frames-and-state.lisp")

The call of (gen-file) after successful planning will output the extended plan
representation.  

To use this process along with the code that copnverts the intermediate states
into abstract vectors, perform the following.

(load "w:/My Documents/prodigy/working/system/agent/plans2vectors.lisp")

The subsequent call of (plan2vectors (gen-file)) after successful planning will
output the abstract vector plan representation and can be used with Oates'
A-distance metric.

To modify announce-plan (the plan pretty printer) to do the plan2vectors call
