This code uses Prodigy/Agent to translate plans into Kerkez's format
having intermediate state representations. The files that compose this
module are as follows (the module is defined in the file
prodigy/working/system/agent/loader.lisp).

plans2vectors.lisp
a-dist-eval.lisp
data.lisp
data-alt.lisp 
plan2frames-and-state.lisp

To enable Prodigy/Agent set the global variable *interactive-loading*
to t in the file prodigy/working/system-loader.lisp. During the
interactive start-up, load both the monitor and Prodigy/Agent modules
(see Lisp session output at bottom of this file).  Then perform one of
the following load operations.

(load-a-dist) ;Default is 'logistics.
(load-a-dist 'extended-strips) 
(load-a-dist 'blocksworld)

The call of (gen-file) after successful planning will output the
extended plan representation. The subsequent call of (plan2vectors
(gen-file)) after successful planning will output the abstract vector
plan representation and can be used with Oates' A-distance metric.

Create a set of new problems in the logistics domain (note that if you
are using another domain, the value of *predicates* will be different)
using Kerkez's code.  Find this code at
E:\CopiesJunJul08\PlanRec_CODE\RUN_PLAN_REC_SYSTEM.bat


;;; For parameter 100, substitute your number of problems
(solve-problems 100)
;;; or to write to data.txt in the *data-directory*
(solve-problems 100 t)

The vector form of the solutions will be in reverse order as the value
of *vector-results*

;;; HERE IS A SEQUENCE OF CALLS THAT SOLVES 10 LOGISTICS PROBLEMS WITH
;;; A NORMAL DOMAIN AND THEN WITH AN ANOMALOUS DOMAIN. THIS ASSUMES
;;; THAT THE ANOMALOUS DOMAIN IS IN A FILE CALLED domain.anomalous.
;;; (SEE LOAD SEQUENCE AND RUN AT BOTTOM OF FILE FOR EXAMPLE)
(load-a-dist)
(solve-problems 10 t)
(init-anomalous-run)
(solve-problems 10 t 300 
		(format  nil 
		"~adata-anomalous.txt"
		*data-directory*))
(restore-file-names)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;;; Do we need to call initialize to set *target-width* and *increment-width*?
(prep-pools)
(assemble-data)
(output-answers 110 0.45 
  (eval-and-write 110 0.45))
;;; or to calculate at varying epsilons
(dotimes (epsilon 8)
  (output-answers 110 (/ (+ 1 epsilon) 10) 
     (eval-and-write 110 (/ (+ 1 epsilon) 10))))
