;;; 
;;; p4p-x2.lisp is the simple problem of non-empty view window
;;; 
;;; with NO INPUT FROM THE ENVIRONMENT 
;;; 
;;; The solution: Load_Window must be minimized instead of View_Window killed.
;;; 
;;; This version uses the threshhold and (on <w> SCR) predicate for determining
;;; clutter.
;;; 
;;; Difference between this and p4p-x1.lisp is that (is-empty View_Window) is
;;; commented out.
