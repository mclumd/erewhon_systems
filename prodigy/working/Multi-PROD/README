To run two copies of PRODIGY do the following:

Start lisp in emacs
Reply with 6 "y"s, 3 "n"s.
load /usr/local/users/mcox/Research/PRODIGY/Multi-PROD/accepter.lisp

Start another lisp in another emacs
Reply with 6 "y"s, 3 "n"s.
load /usr/local/users/mcox/Research/PRODIGY/Multi-PROD/sharer.lisp

Go back to first lisp
enter "y"
Go back to second lisp
enter "y"

---------------------

The demo uses two domains: accepter and sharer. The differences between them
are in the arm-empty predicate. The former uses a-arm-empty, whereas the latter
uses s-arm-empty. This was the quickest way for me to resolve the conflict
between the different versions. Each require a separate robot arm.

---------------------

NOTE that the number of y and n responses is specific to Cox's .clinit.cl.

Generalize these instructions later.
