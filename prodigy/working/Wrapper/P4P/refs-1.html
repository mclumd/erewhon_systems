<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>Case-based planning (CBP) systems are an important class of
case-based reasoning (CBR) systems, and thus a large amount of research
has addressed their design and performance. Most of this work has
focused on completely automated, rather than interactive, planning.
However, other CBR research has recently explored a `conversational'
metaphor that supports user interaction during case retrieval and
adaptation. We review previous CBP research, and describe CBP
requirements for a conversational framework. In particular, we
introduce a design for a conversational case-based planner that
integrates a conversational CBR tool, NaCoDAE, a high performance query
retrieval tool, Parka-DB, and a case-based planner, CAPlan/CbC</dd>

  <dd>Most recently, attention has focused on adaptive interface in the
human-computer interface domain. In this paper, several fundamental
concepts of adaptive interfaces are introduced, then an adaptive
mechanism of user interface is presented based on these concepts. The
structure and technology of this architecture are discussed in detail.
This architecture has been applied to GS-ICCC (GreatSky-Integrated CAD,
CAPP and CAM), which is an integrated CAD/CAPP/CAM system. Some details
of implementing this architecture are also described. The adaptive
architecture of GS-ICCC has been implemented based on X-Window/Motif
environments. It has been proved to be highly efficient</dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>This paper uses a framework of three central user interface
issues-user's conceptual model of the system, human-computer dialogue,
and evaluation of usability-as a basis for examining a knowledge-based
expert system, the Strategy Planning Advisor (SPA). SPA is an
experimental microcomputer-based system intended to support managers
with decision-making responsibility for enterprise-wide or strategic
business unit planning. Its user interface design, which is anchored in
human factors research, doubled the development time and cost in order
to produce a more user-acceptable system. This paper reports on the
design process and lessons learned from the evolving project which
provides insights to practitioners and researchers concerned with
planning and building expert systems</dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>We claim that automatic multimedia presentation can be modeled by
integrating two complementary approaches to automatic design:
hierarchical planning to achieve communicative goals, and task-based
graphic design. The interface between the two approaches is a domain
and media independent layer of communicative goals and actions. A
planning process decomposes domain-specific goals to domain-independent
goals, which in turn are realized by media-specific techniques. One of
these techniques is task-based graphic design. We apply our approach to
presenting information from large data sets using natural language and
information graphics</dd>

  <dd>Provides a conceptual overview of an integrated knowledge
structure architecture for the domain and user modules of an
intelligent interface to tactical planning. The discussion builds on
earlier work on causal schemas as potential interface devices for
plan-generation in the tactical military sphere; in addition, it draws
on other work in cognitive psychology on a new and more comprehensive
scheme for representing knowledge. Also, the paper is anchored in
earlier research on embedded planning models as well as recent efforts
on intelligent interface architecture. This research is related to
other efforts on the use of causal structures as interfaces in decision
support systems</dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>The authors report on the design and implementation of an
intelligent interface that assists users performing computer-based
professional work by recognizing sequences of actions that are globally
consistent and meet desired goals. The approach is based on
hierarchical plans that represent user tasks. Recognition of
instantiations of these plans occurs by predicting future actions from
past events and then matching new actions to these predictions. The
intelligent interface GRAPPLE (goal recognition and planning
environment) extends a previous system primarily through a
reformulation of the plans, incorporating more knowledge about the
plans and the domain. This new formalism lays the groundwork for the
development of metaplans and reasoning from first principles</dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>The widespread use of GUIs for interacting with software is
leading to the construction of more and more complex GUIs. With the
growing complexity comes challenges in testing the correctness of a GUI
and the underlying software. We present a new technique to
automatically generate test cases for GUIs that exploits planning, a
well developed and used technique in artificial intelligence. Given a
set of operators, an initial state and a goal state, a planner produces
a sequence of the operators that will change the initial state to the
goal state. Our test case generation technique first analyzes a GUI and
derives hierarchical planning operators from the actions in the GUI.
The test designer determines the preconditions and effects of the
hierarchical operators, which are then input into a planning system.
With the knowledge of the GUI and the way in which the user will
interact with the GUI, the test designer creates sets of initial and
goal states. Given these initial and final states of the GUI, a
hierarchical planner produces plans, or a set of test cases, that
enable the goal state to be reached. Our technique has the additional
benefit of putting verification commands into the test cases
automatically. We implemented our technique by developing the GUI
analyzer and extending a planner. We generated test cases for
Microsoft's Word-Pad to demonstrate the viability and practicality of
the approach</dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>One important approach to enhancing software reuse is through the
creation of large scale software libraries. However, knowing the
requirements and formats of each of these routines requires
considerable expertise-thus limiting the usage of these libraries by
novices. The paper describes an approach to enable novices to use
complex software libraries. In this approach, the interactions between
and requirements of the software modules are represented in a
declarative language based on artificial intelligence (AI) planning
techniques. The user is then able to specify their goals in terms of
this language-designating what they want done, not how to do it. The AI
planning system then uses this model of the available subroutines to
compose a domain specific script to fulfil the user request.
Specifically, we describe three such systems developed by the
Artificial Intelligence Group of the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The
Multimission VICAR Planner (MVP) has been deployed for 2 years and
supports image processing for science product generation for the
Galileo mission. MVP has reduced time to fill certain classes of
requests from 4 hours to 15 minutes. The Automated SAR Image Processing
system (ASIP) is currently in use by the geology department at ASU to
support aeolian science analysis of synthetic aperture radar images.
Finally, the DPLAN system reconfigures software modules which control
complex antenna hardware to configure antennas to support a wide range
of tracks for NASA's Deep Space Network of communications and radio
science antennas</dd>

<dt>Abstract</dt>
  <dd>A visual environment for designing sequence control program with
AI planning is described. In order to increase productivity and improve
the quality and reliability of the control specifications, the authors
have been developing a planning-based Visual Programming System for
Sequence Control Program Specification Design (VIPS/S-SFCD).
VIPS/S-SFCD features an example-based programming technique in which
designers specify the initial states and goal states of machines using
visual representations, and generates control specification by AI
planning. To overcome the difficulty of dealing with complex
data/knowledge of the planner, VIPS/S-SFCD analyzes and confirms user
intention using context-dependent valence theory and case grammar. They
used VIPS/S-SFCD to experimentally generate control program
specifications for actually existing steel plants. The experimental
results showed that visual representation with dynamic, intuitional
icons, the coverage of the grammar rule, and generating time of control
specification are practical</dd>
