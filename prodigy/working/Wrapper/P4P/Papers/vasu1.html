<P>
In developing a client/server application, an important phase
of the development is the planning for the User Interface (UI).
Whitten, Bentley &amp; Barlow (1994) states that the UI design
is the specification of a conversation between the computer user
and the computer. The result of this conversation is either input
to or output from the system. Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) have 
become the user interface of choice (Hobart, 1995). A GUI uses icons 
(pictures to represent the application or a file), pop-up windows, scroll bars and pull-down menus to communicate
with users. GUIs are intuitive, easy to use and learn (Tomaiuolo, 1996), 
reduce input errors, and reduces time to key in information. <BR>

<P>
Both the keyboard and function keys are used for input. Pointing
devices are used to select options on the GUI screens. Pointing
device options available are mice, trackballs, pens, and trackpoints.
Again, the use of pointers reduce key inputs and errors from the
users.<BR>

<P>
Hobart (1995) states that the systems designer should follow these basic 
rules to designing a successful GUI: 
<OL>
<LI>Understand people - be sure the application reflects the perspectives 
and behaviors of the users.
<LI>Be careful of perspectives - use reserved icons to help eliminate 
problems with users not understanding the meaning of a creative icon.
<LI>Design for clarity - develop and use a list of reserved words that 
the user can understand. Apply these words consistently across the 
application.
<LI>Design for consistency - apply consistent behavior throughout the 
application and build upon a user's prior knowledge of other applications.
<LI>Provide visual feedback - use progress boxes to display messages on 
how much longer an operation will continue, or how long it has been 
performing.
<LI>Provide audible feedback - use when needed to warn users of an 
impending serious problem.
<LI>Keep text clear - use concise wording of text labels, user error 
messages, and on-line help messages.
<LI>Provide a traceable path - by having intuitive menu structures, a 
user can trace/retrace the path to get out of an application. Flatten the 
menu structure and avoid use of more than two levels of cascading menus.
<LI>Provide keyboard support - use keyboard accelerators to provide an 
efficient way for users to access specific menu items within the window. 
Don't assume all input and accesses will be mouse driven.
<LI>Watch the presentation model - the interface's look and feel is the 
critical aspect that ties all the above facets together. The model should 
involve careful decisions. The model will validate how users perform their 
tasks within the application.
</OL>


<P> Per Whitten, Bentley and Barlow (1994) there are 
three steps in the design phase for the user interface. They are:
<OL>
<LI>Chart the dialogue
<LI>Prototype or simulate the dialogue and user interface
<LI>If necessary, produce programmer-oriented layout charts.
</OL>
All this should be done following the guidelines associated with
human factors associated with such implementations. <BR>

<P>
The implementation of the GUI to the Remote Distributed LAN Support
Server Trouble Log System will utilize the following guidelines
suggested by Whitten, Bentley and Barlow.
<OL>
<LI>Users should know what to do next by defining what the system
expects at the current step, validation of data, completed tasks.

<LI>Screens will be structured so that various types of information,
instructions, messages, etc. appear in the same general display
area.
<LI>Dialog in the body zone will be limited to one idea per frame.
<LI>Information will remain in the zones long enough for users
to read it.
<LI>Display attributes will be use sparingly. Blinking, reverse
video, etc. will be avoided. Colors will be limited to two per
page if possible.
<LI>Complex functions will be assigned to function keys if possible.
Use of standard Microsoft Access and Windows function calls, icons,
key strokes, etc. will be used. Movement from screen to screen
will be via mouse selections.
<LI>Default values will be specified where applicable.
<LI>Attempts will be made to anticipate user errors in input.
<BR>

</OL>

<P>
<B>CHART of DIALOGUE</B>
<BR>
Document dialogue is usually done with a state transition diagram.
This diagram is used to design and document the user interface
screens. Arrows indicate the sequence in which one moves from
one screen to another. The sequence of screens should follow a
natural order, one after another. The path to the next screen
should be based on input from the client. The mouse or default
Microsoft escape (ESC) key will be used to exit from menus. The
Server Trouble Tracking System will use a minimum of 6 screens.
The following is the flow of dialogue for the prototype Server
Trouble Tracking System: <BR>

<BR>
<BR>
<B>PROTOTYPE GUI SCREENS</B>
<BR>
The prototype screen forms use the integrated Visual Basic scripting 
langage included with the Microsoft Office Suite. The final 
implementation will convert the system to use Visual Basic run time front 
ends for data input, manipulation and reporting. This will allow the 
database to run across platforms and not need the actual Microsoft Access 
package residing on the server.
<BR>
<P> The initial opening menu screen will use 
the 'switchboard' 
feature of Microsoft Access, version 7.0. The switchboard is a front-end
menu screen that allows the user to select choices to perform
on the database. 
<P>
The following are the screens used in the Server Trouble Tracking
System:<BR>

<P>
Opening Menu System:<BR>

<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="mainmenu.gif" ALT="Main Menu Screen"><BR>
</CENTER>
<BR>From this screen, the user will select with a mouse click the button 
for the application they wish to enter. From that selection, one of 4 
additional input screens, or a report screen will appear.
<P>
The first four menu options will lead to the following four screens:
<P>
Option 1 - to enter and or update records into the Problem table:
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="trouble.gif" ALT="Trouble Input Screen"><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
This screen uses drop-down bars for input, and selection buttons at the 
bottom of the screen. All this is designed to ease user input and 
provide guide steps in the input process.
<P>
Option 2 - to enter new items to or update the solutions table:
<p>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="fix.gif" ALT="Solutions Input Screen"><P>
</CENTER>
<BR>
This screen will also use drop-down bars to select the appropriate 
trouble to post a solution for. The drop-down will also be used on the 
device field to assure the problem number is assigned to the correct 
device.
<BR>
<P>
Option 3 and 4 - update the Server and the ITOP Personnel tables.
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="server1.gif" ALT="Server Update Screen"><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
<CENTER>
<IMG SRC="support.gif" ALT=Personnel Update Screen"><BR>
</CENTER>
<P>
Option 5 - to preview reports is not implemented for this project.
It will be added later in the developments.<BR>

<P>
Option 6 - closes and exits the database.
