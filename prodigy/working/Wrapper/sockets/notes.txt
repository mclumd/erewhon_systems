here's a tarred/compressed/uuencoded bunch of source files for the
actual sockets themselves. you'll have to twiddle the directories
quite a bit, this is wired tightly into my dept's directory structure.

you can create two/three files for each architecture...libsock.a and
sock.o and sock.so (which is N/A for sunos)

more code to follow, the prodigy-specific stuff
