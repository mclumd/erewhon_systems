get_id

Form:		isa(next_id, M)

Summary:	When isa(get_id, X) is true, a new, unique ID number 
		is created for X (a concept) by asserting has(X, id_num, N)
		where N is the number created by adding 1 to the most 
		recently used ID number.

Parameters:	X, the item to receive the ID number; N, the ID number

*/ 

	// Set initial value of the most recent number used as 0.
	+isa(most_recent_ID_number, 0).

	// If X isa 'get_id' and the most recent ID number used is M,
	// then N = M + 1, and X has ID_num N, the new most recent
	// ID number is N, and X is no longer 'get_id'.
	+isa(get_id, X) & is(most_recent_ID_number, M) & eval("alma.callfile.AlmaInterger.add", M, [1], N)
		-> has(X, id_num, N) & isa(most_recent_ID_number, N) & -isa(get_id, X).
