Imagine that the manufacturers of the systems listed below, will tailor the base models to suit your specific needs. List either the different needs you have for each system and if possible list additional features that you will like the system to have to cater to your needs. For example, if there is a switch that can turn a light on or off, an additional feature I may like is to have an associated timer that I can set, to turn the light on or off at pre-determined times.



1. A switch that can turn a light on or off.

























2. A microwave that can be just switched on and off. Now, if you need to heat milk for 20 seconds, YOU need to put the milk in, YOU need to switch it on, YOU need to keep note of the time, YOU need to wait for 20 seconds and then YOU need to switch it off.

















3. A CD player that displays the current track and can play, rewind, fast forward or stop.

























4. A room heater that displays the current temperature and can be switched on or off.


























5. A remote-controlled car starter that displays the status of the engine - running or stopped and can start or stop the engine.
