What is XBoard?
===============
XBoard is a graphical chessboard that can serve as a user interface
for GNU Chess, for the Internet Chess Server, or for electronic mail
correspondence chess.  XBoard can also be used by itself.  See the
manual page xboard.man for further details; use the command "nroff
-man xboard.man | more" to read it.

Building XBoard
===============
Quick start:  You can build xboard on most systems with the commands

	configure
	make

See the file INSTALL for more detailed instructions.

See the file FAQ for answers to frequently asked questions.

Reporting problems
==================

Report bugs and problems with XBoard to <tim@tim-mann.org>.  Please
use the "script" program to start a typescript, run XBoard with the
-debug option, and include the typescript output in your message.
Also tell us what kind of machine and what operating system version
you are using.  The command "uname -a" will often tell you this.

Here is a sample of approximately what you should type:

    script
    uname -a
    ./configure
    make
    ./xboard -debug
    exit
    mail tim@tim-mann.org
    Subject: Your short description of the problem
    Your detailed description of the problem
    ~r typescript
    .

If you improve XBoard, please send a message about your changes, and
we will get in touch with you about merging them in to the main line
of development.

Caveats
=======
XBoard depends on the Xt Intrinsics and Athena Widget Set of X11R4 or
later.  In particular, X11R3 just won't do.

XBoard works best with version 4.0 or 5.0 of GNU Chess.  Older
versions may also work, but they are unsupported.  The GNU Chess
project requests that you get a current copy of GNU Chess rather than
using older, bug-ridden versions.  GNU Chess 4.0 must be compiled with
the -DXBOARD flag for use with XBoard.  Use the "make gnuchessx"
target in GNU Chess 4.0 to do this.

The Free Software Foundation would prefer to be able to distribute an
X chessboard program covered only by the GNU General Public License
and unencumbered by any other copyright.  If you can help with this,
please contact the FSF.
