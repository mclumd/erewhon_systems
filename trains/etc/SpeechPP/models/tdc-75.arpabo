This backoff trigram model uses a vocabulary of 387 words,
   which begins "-TON", "</s>" "<s>" ...
This is an OPEN-vocabulary model (type 1)
   (OOVs were mapped to UNK, which is treated as any other vocabulary word)
It was constructed using 41875 trigrams and their counts

The UNIGRAM component is based on 36505 words
   there are 113 distinct unigram counts,  maximum unigram count is 5211
   there are 0 zerotons;  P(zeroton) was limited to 1.000 of P(singleton)
   unigram freq-of-freq.: 0 86 43 38 15 ...
   Good-Turing discount ratios:  (none)

The BIGRAM component is based on 3415 distinct bigrams
   maximal bigram count is 5211
   bigram freq-of-freq.: 1650 504 258 154 113 87 54 ...
   1650 bigrams occurred 1 or fewer times and were excluded;
   only 1765 bigrams were retained
   Good-Turing discount ratios:  0.00 0.70 0.74 0.89 0.90 0.64

The TRIGRAM component is based on 8535 distinct trigrams
   maximal trigram count is 789
   trigram freq-of-freq.: 5105 1225 588 326 207 ...
   5105 trigrams occurred 1 or fewer times and were excluded;
   only 3430 trigrams were retained
   Good-Turing discount ratios:  0.00 0.65 0.67 0.74

This file is in the ARPA-standard format introduced by Doug Paul.

p(wd3|wd1,wd2)= if(trigram exists)           p_3(wd1,wd2,wd3)
                else if(bigram w1,w2 exists) bo_wt_2(w1,w2)*p(wd3|wd2)
                else                         p(wd3|w2)

p(wd2|wd1)= if(bigram exists) p_2(wd1,wd2)
            else              bo_wt_1(wd1)*p_1(wd2)

All probs and back-off weights (bo_wt) are given in log10 form.
