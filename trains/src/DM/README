This is a distribution version of the TRAINS-96 v2.2 discourse
manager module. It has only been tested under Allegro CL 4.3. Although
it is fairly portable (no multi-processing, CLIM, etc.), there are a
few remaining Allegro-specific bits. Most of these are in
id/tt-lispmodule.lisp (as far as I can tell), and deal with things
like listening for input on a stream and selecting for input. They
could be simplified or ported fairly easily.
