To build the TRAINS-96 v2.2 SpeechIn module, you need Sphinx-II
sources from CMU (available by license). The directory `Sphinx' should
contain that source tree, and the directory `SpeechData' should
contain the speech models needed at run-time. These can both be
symlinks (as they are in the TRAINS distribution), and the precise
layout can be modified by changing the Makefile in this directory.
