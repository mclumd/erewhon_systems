	      README for TRAINS System config directory

			      14 Jan 1997


The TRAINS System will build using either Sun make or GNU make
(gmake). If you aren't using Sun make, you can get gmake from
prep.ai.mit.edu or other GNU sites. Other makes might work: you would
have to adjust the way UNAME is set (see next paragraph), and probably
check that pattern-matching rules (those involving `%') work right.

Most modules of the TRAINS System include one of the "make.rules.*"
files in their Makefile. These files all load TRAINS System version
info ("make.version") and a platform-specific set of definitions
("make.defs.<UNAME>"). You will need to edit both of these included
files:

  - make.version:
      - The value of UNAME is set to the output of "uname -s" and
	"uname -r", separated by a period (eg., "SunOS.5.5.1"). You
	will have to either adjust this for your version of make or
	hardcode the appropriate value.
      - You will also need to set the value of TRAINS_BASE, used in
	programs at runtime and also by the build and install process.

  - make.defs.<UNAME>:
	You will need to adjust these settings to reflect your local
	environment. You can either edit the distributed per-platform
	configuration files (if your platform is one of them), or copy
	one of them to the appropriate name and edit it (if not).

Note: Some definitions are only used for some modules. A few modules
require additional configuration. You should be able to use the main
README to figure what matters depending on what you're building.
