Instructions for building UMBC_UTILS
------------------------------------

Required packages:

- g++, standard c/c++ headers, and make


Preparing for the build:

- you should ensure that there are makefiles for your OS and machine in 
  the "make" directory:
  + make.$(MACHINENAME)
  + make.$(OS)
  
  These files should define and/or override all OS or machine-specific
  commands & directories to meet the minimum functionality required in
  the build.
  

Build Instructions:

- after having specified the location for the install in the local 
  makefile, "make install" in the build directory.
  
  this step will first build the Utils library, then copy it to
  $(SYS_LIBDIR)
  then it will copy the headers in the api/mcl directory to
  $(SYS_INCLUDEDIR)/umbc/


Usage:

- link your executables against -lUMBC  
- for individual utility usage, including settings, see the included 
  documentation in docs/guide.pdf
