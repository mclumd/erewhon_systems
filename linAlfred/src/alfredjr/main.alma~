loadcall "get_utterance" "alma.callfile.GetUtterance".
loadcall "unique_id" "alma.callfile.UniqueID".

//	The GetUtterance call will: 1) create 
//	a user-interface window; 2) try to retrieve a user utterance 
//	that has been entered into the window; 3) if there is no 
//	utterance, then it tries again every step until an utterance is 
//	entered; 4) if there is an utterance U, it generates a unique
//	ID and saves it in the formulas 'isa(ID,new_utterance)' & 
//	'has(ID, spelling, U); 5) because the select command below 
//	does not include a number (in the brackets), the command is
//	interpreted as looking for an infinite number of new utterances.
//	Therefore, steps 2,3,4 are repeated throughout the session.

#{isa(ID, utterance) & isa(ID, new) & has(ID, spelling, X)}[] get_utterance(ID,X).

//	The query below directs Alfred to look for a rover command string
//	if there is a current utterance.
//	When one is found, the string itself becomes the value of the predicate
//	'rover_command_string'.
